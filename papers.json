      "abstract": "Unlike traditional autism awareness programs that often rely on didactic teaching and factual information, Human Library is a contact-based intervention that can engage “readers” in critical dialogs with “human books” to learn about their lived experience. This study reported on the pilot development of a Human Library in collaboration with a team of human books who are autistic to promote public understanding of autism in Hong Kong. Using a participatory realist evaluation framework, we conducted surveys and interviews with readers to construct a Human Library program model and evaluate its associated outcomes. Pre- and post-Human Library surveys showed a significant decrease in autism stigma and increase in neurodiversity attitudes. Interview findings revealed that readers’ interests and concerns about the autistic community motivated them to participate in Human Library. Through personal interaction with autistic human books in a safe space created within Human Library, readers developed renewed understanding of autism and insights into autistic strengths. Readers became more informed of autistic people’s perspectives and various sociocultural barriers that impact their well-bei…",

      "abstract": "In recent years, referrals of youth to specialised gender services have risen sharply, with ~11% of these youth diagnosed as autistic compared with a general population rate of ~1%. In two preregistered studies, we addressed this insufficiently understood intersection. In Study 1, we examined the number and developmental trajectory of autism traits in autistic and nonautistic gender clinic-referred and cisgender youth (aged 7–16 years) using both screening measures (Autism-Spectrum Quotient Children’s Version and Autism-Spectrum Quotient Adolescent Version, Social Communication Questionnaire–Lifetime) and diagnostic tools (Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised, Brief Observation of Symptoms of Autism). In Study 2, we examined autism traits among the caregivers of participants from each group using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient Adolescent Version. Study 1 results showed the autism phenotype in autistic gender clinic-referred youth closely resembled that of their cisgender autistic peers. In addition, after addressing methodological limitations in previous research, we found no evidence of elevated autism traits in nonautistic gender clinic-referred youth, challenging findings of some e…"

Among non-autistic adults with social anxiety, distorted negative self-imagery in social situations stemming from fear of negative evaluation from observers can be corrected in cognitive therapy via video feedback. However, the role of social imagery in the maintenance of social anxiety has not been explored in autistic adults. This study examined in 62 autistic adults: (1) quality of social imagery elicited during social situations; (2) how image qualities were related to self-reported levels of social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation when accounting for co-occurring generalised anxiety. Many autistic adults reported social imagery from a field (i.e., looking through one’s own eyes) rather than observer perspective. Using response surface analysis (RSA), autistic adults wanted to escape from/avoid social imagery and found them more upsetting when social anxiety was greater than fear of negative evaluation from others. Social imagery may be linked to autistic adults’ somatic and sensory responses related to social anxiety rather than cognitive worries assoc…",

This article concludes that autistic identity has no connection to potential eating disorder symptom severity. However, the psychometric tool used, the Social Identity Scale, is missing key aspects of autistic identity found in other tools. In addition, the tool used is not validated in autistic adults. Lay Abstract A recent paper by Bradley et al. concluded that there is no relationship between autistic identity and eating disorder symptoms. However, the survey tool used to assess autistic identity of its participants did not include key components needed to arrive at this conclusion. Variations of autistic identity that would need to be considered are manifold. Some of these facets to consider in a survey assessing autistic identity would be whether or not autism is a source of pride, traits are thought to be steadfast or changeable, stigma is felt, and whether they should perform camouflaging behavior. This is important because eating disorder symptoms can be affected by thes…",

This article describes the process and service-level feasibility of implementing this program over the course of one academic year at a large public university in the Northeast United States. Anxiety, depression, and suicide risk were measured at four time points. Students with elevated risk of mental health symptoms were connected to mental health supports and received suicide risk assessments. Thirty-two individuals took part in the monitoring process across the academic year. The monitoring process identified 53 instances where monitoring, checking-in, or a risk assessment was indicated. Fourteen risk assessments occurred, and 12 students received at least one mental health referral. Leveraging interdisciplinary collaborations, the mental health monitoring program was able to connect numerous autistic college students facing mental…"

Although cognitive-behavioural therapy in group settings has been adapted for autistic populations, there is a paucity of research exploring how autistic individuals experience CBT interventions. This qualitative study investigated autistic adults’ experiences of a modified cognitive-behavioural therapy group programme for social anxiety. Twenty-seven autistic participants were recruited through clinical services and community outreach. Following the intervention, participants completed semi-structured individual interviews about their experience of the programme. Participants reported both therapeutic benefits and challenges following their participation. Themes included reflections on group dynamics, mental health impacts, social functioning and daily life applications of strategies. Peer connection emerged as a core facilitator of engagement, while structured strategies were credited with bolstering social confidence and self-awareness.

Acoustic cues, such as vocal characteristics and spatial location, help differentiate between speakers. However, autistic individuals may process these cues differently, making it more challenging for them to perceive speech in such conditions. This study investigated how autistic individuals use acoustic cues to follow a target speaker and whether background music increases processing demands. Thirty-six autistic and 36 non-autistic participants, recruited in the United Kingdom, identified information from a target speaker while ignoring a competing speaker and background music. The competing speaker’s gender and location either matched or differed from the target. The autistic group exhibited lower mean accuracy across cue conditions, indicating general challenges in recognising speech in noise. Trial-level analyses revealed that while both groups showed accuracy improvements over time without acoustic cues, the autistic group demonstrated smaller gains, suggesting greater difficulty in tracking the target speaker without distinct acoustic features.

However, prevailing frameworks often equate independence with functional proficiency and physical separation from the family, rarely capturing the lived realities and priorities of autistic individuals and their families. This qualitative study represents the first exploration of how families of autistic adults in mainland China understand, support and engage with the concept of independence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 parents of autistic adults, including individuals both with and without intellectual disabilities. Through reflexive thematic analysis, four interrelated themes were identified: (1) Doing Independence Versus Being Independent; (2) From Aspirations to Reconceptualisations; (3) Invisible Needs and Misrecognised Competence; and (4) Independence as a Relational Process. These findings challenge reductive definitions of independence as mere task completion or detachment from familial support.

The proposed methodology involves collecting a data set with attributes such as verbal ability, social interaction, sensory sensitivity, and attention span for students with autism spectrum disorder. These features are preprocessed and used to train a TabNet model to categorize the autism level. The system recommends a personalized education plan through a web application, based on prediction. This study uniquely integrates autism spectrum disorder-level prediction with education planning, achieving an accuracy of 99.37% and precision of 98.91% using the Autism Spectrum Classification for Education Planning data set.

      "abstract": "There is an increasing need to measure caregiver implementation of strategies from Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs) as a possible key mediator of outcomes in a child. The NDBI Fidelity (NDBI-Fi) rating scheme is a macro-code to estimate the implementation of core strategies. Yet, there is a need to understand the dependability of this measure to ensure intervention study findings are generalizable to everyday interactions and comparable across studies. We addressed this by evaluating the dependability or consistency of NDBI-Fi scores for 20 caregivers, averaged across observations of two occasions of two routines that were each scored by two raters. Our findings indicated that a single score (i.e. from a single occasion, single routine, and single rater) from the measure has low dependability ( g = 0.43). When scores were averaged across two observations each of two routines scored by two raters (i.e. eight scores total), the score was more dependable ( g = 0.77). The majority (81.6%) of absolute error variance was attributable to occasions of observation and its interaction with other facets (routine or rater). Therefore, we recommend the NDBI-Fi be appl…"

This convergent mixed-methods study explored the eye care experiences of 127 autistic adults and 69 parents of autistic children living in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. Through an online survey incorporating both structured and open-ended items, we examined access patterns, perceived barriers and enablers, and unmet needs. Quantitative data revealed widespread challenges, including sensory discomfort, communication difficulties, and financial costs, while qualitative responses foregrounded how provider interaction, clinical pacing, and environmental conditions shaped overall experience. Although participants valued clearer communication and sensory-informed adjustments, these were described as insufficient in the face of structural barriers such as affordability and inaccessible service locations. These findings align with emerging models of autism-informed healthcare that advocate for systemic, rather than ad hoc, approaches to accessibility.

      "abstract": "Autistic individuals are disproportionately likely to experience suicidal thoughts, feelings, and actions. Addressing suicidality is also a high priority of autistic community members. The goal of this study was to understand broad influences on suicidality and suicide-prevention needs for the autistic community. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we conducted a reflective thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 16 autistic adults, 8 family members, and 14 mental health providers. Themes summarizing influences on suicidality and suicide-prevention needs centered on three broad thematic concepts: (1) Pervasive negative societal attitudes and social experiences have a lasting impact on autistic people’s feelings of worth; (2) negative experiences and stressors add strain, making life feel overwhelming and hopeless; and (3) difficulty regulating and managing emotions can increase the likelihood of suicidal feelings and actions. Participants provided autism-specific recommendations to incorporate into suicide prevention. The findings emphasize the need for multifaceted suicide-prevention efforts supporting autistic people through improved societal treatme…",

Consequently, the goal of the current study was to conduct a systematic review that helps clarify the cognitive characteristics of ADHD in older individuals. Method: We conducted a systematic review with narrative synthesis, considering studies on older adults with ADHD and research on cognitive domains involved in adults 50 years old and older with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase). Ten studies (3 longitudinal and 7 cross-sectional) with clearly separated cognitive data for older adults with ADHD were included in this review. Results: Results showed an overall worse performance in attention and episodic memory for older adults with ADHD compared to their younger counterparts and older healthy controls. Evidence concerning executive functions was mixed, with some studies showing a worse performance in working memory compared to older healthy controls, but with other studies showing a similar or even better performance than younger adult…"

This study examined the extent to which the cognitive impairments could be consequences of elevated levels of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Method: Secondary analysis was conducted on data from four groups selected from the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory, a neurodivergent cohort of children aged 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 9 years : children with ADHD only ( n = 70), learning difficulties only ( n = 406), ADHD with learning difficulties ( n = 128), and a comparison group ( n = 166). Covariance analyses examined whether any differences in basic cognitive skills and higher executive functions between the neurodivergent and comparison groups could result from variations in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Results: Irrespective of ADHD status, children with learning difficulties had low scores in short-term memory, working memory, sustained attention, processing speed, set sequencing, and set shifting. These cognitive deficits largely persisted when inattention and hyperactivity/impu…"

      "abstract": "Objective: Experiences of “auditory hyper-reactivity” and decreased sound tolerance, which can be separated into phenotypes such as hyperacusis and misophonia, are prevalent in autism and ADHD and impact quality of life and wellbeing. Furthermore, atypical patterns of attention regulations—including hyper-focus and inattention—are common in both autism and ADHD. Prior research also suggests sensory hyper-reactivity can cause anxiety, and anxiety can be associated with hyper-vigilance. It is currently unclear whether hyper-focusing on stimuli, having one’s attention captured by them, or being hyper-vigilant toward them could lead to sensory hyper-reactivity. Therefore, this study investigates relationships among hyper-focus, inattention, hyper-vigilance, auditory hyper-reactivity, and anxiety. Method: Four hundred ninety-two adults (122 ADHD-only, 130 autistic-only, 141 autistic + ADHD, and 99 comparison) completed questionnaires indexing hyper-focus, inattention, and various forms of auditory hyper-reactivity; participants also completed a psychoacoustic measure by rating the pleasantness of misophonic trigger sounds.

The neural mechanism(s) underlying this interdependence have not been identified; however, the locus coeruleus – norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may provide a potential explanation for this interaction. Further, both alerting–cognitive control interdependence and LC-NE activity may be altered in autistic individuals, and thus may provide a unique window into the relationship between the LC-NE system and network interdependence. The objective of the current study was to utilize electrophysiological and pupillary indices of LC-NE activity to examine the associations between attentional network interdependence, LC-NE activity, and autism and ADHD traits. Methods: A total of 77 neurotypical undergraduate students completed two tasks: (1) a resting eye-tracking task to measure pupil diameter (tonic LC activity), and (2) a cued-flanker task to measure cue-related pupil diameter response (cue PDR; phasic LC activity) and attentional network interdependence using behavioral, electrophysiological, a…",

Method: The present study evaluated 75 children (ages 6.09–12.99 years, 72% male) and 37 teenagers (ages 13–16.95 years, 62% male) with ADHD, and a sex-and-age matched sample of typically developing peers. They were tested with 103 pairs of illusory and control images spanning five illusion types.

The ‘Thinking Flexibly’ intervention has been co-designed with autistic youth based on previous work, including cognitive remediation therapy. Twenty autistic adolescents were recruited from clinical services and offered the eight-session intervention. Acceptability was assessed through participant drop-out and session completion. Participants (and their parents) also completed questionnaire measures of cognitive inflexibility, anxiety, depression and functional outcomes before and after the intervention. Our results indicated good acceptability with 19/20 participants completing the intervention and session attendance was high, with a single missed session.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Parent–child biobehavioral synchrony, or the concordance of behavior and physiological indicators between individuals, is theorized to support children's social development; however, this relationship has yet to be investigated in autistic children. This study examined whether moment‐to‐moment physiological synchrony—indexed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)—and its interface with global levels of behavioral synchrony was associated with the pragmatic language skills and friendship quality of school‐aged autistic children in 40 mother–child dyads. Mother–child dyads participated in a collaborative task, from which RSA synchrony and behavioral synchrony were assessed. Mothers and their autistic children demonstrated negative RSA synchrony, such that when one partner displayed an increase in RSA, the other partner showed a decrease in RSA. The extent of behavioral synchrony between mothers and their children did not moderate the strength of concordance between mother and child RSA. Negative RSA synchrony was associated with better pragmatic language skills in autistic children from mother–child dyads who displayed high levels of behavioral synchrony. These findings high…",

      "abstract": "Autistic people face touch-related challenges, yet the factors influencing these difficulties are not well understood. We developed a novel instrument to capture social touch experiences of autistic adults, along with both social and individual factors that influence them. Using a body-painting task and questionnaires, we demonstrated that the perception of touch interactions varies based on social contexts and neurotypes. Autistic adults, on average, prefer touch less, but the type of relationship influences the perceived comfort and meaningfulness of touch similarly in both groups. Regarding the appropriateness, erogeneity, and pleasantness of social touch, the autistic group showed different touch perceptions in professional and friendly scenarios compared to the non-autistic group, whereas touch in intimate scenarios was perceived similarly. Sensory responsivity, touch predictability, social confidence, and touch-related anxiety affect social touch to a greater extent than the non-autistic group. Despite these marked differences in perception, the autistic adults, on average, engage in social touch as frequently as non-autistic adults, and their satisfaction with touch is compa…",

Methods: Using a qualitative approach informed by interpretative phenomenological analysis, this study explored the professional identities, challenges, and contributions of eight licensed autistic therapists in the United States. We recruited participants through targeted outreach in online communities and took part in in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Results: Analysis revealed six superordinate themes: (1) Integration of autistic identity into therapeutic practice, (2) challenges in navigating professional environments, (3) adapting therapy for autistic clients, (4) autistic therapist well-being, (5) unique contributions of autistic therapists, and (6) advocacy and systemic change.

Tabletop role play games (TTRPG) groups have shown potential as a neurodiversity-affirming way to enhance the social connectedness of autistic adolescents and young adults. TTRPGs involve interactive collaborative storytelling through player constructed characters, often with involvement of a Game Master, and include games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Our study aimed to explore the experiences of autistic adolescents and young adults participating in socially led TTRPG groups. Method: We employed a qualitative phenomenological design. Thirteen participants (10 males, 1 female, 2 non-binary/diverse gender) with ages ranging between 14 and 29 years from Australia took part in semi-structured interviews, which we analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: We identified four key themes.

My main aim is to suggest a new interdisciplinary approach to autistic communication that aims to accommodate our different communication styles rather than modify our communication to fit non-autistic communication norms. I call this new interdisciplinary approach ‘autistic linguistic justice’, and introduce five concepts to help initiate research and advocacy on this topic. The concepts I introduce are: the sociolinguistics of securitization, language revitalization, linguistic human rights, language policy and planning, and language ethics. Each concept is briefly introduced, and examples are given of how they can be applied to accommodating autistic communication. In the conclusion, I provide recommendations for how families, practitioners (such as teachers and doctors), autism researchers, and autistic people can use these concepts to help build autistic linguistic justice together. Given that many of the concepts I draw on have been developed by other minoritized communities, I emphasize the need for building respec…",

One-hundred thirty-eight non-autistic community members completed an online survey; mixed-effects and stepwise regression analyses assessed relationships between contact with Autistar and stigma. Focus group interviews with 11 participants drawn from this full survey sample who had extensive contact with Autistar were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Quantitative analyses indicated that greater contact breadth with Autistar was linked to lower stigma. In particular, participation in exhibitions and introduction by acquaintances predicted lower stigma. Qualitative analysis revealed that sustained and informed contact, which allowed participants to notice similarities between themselves and autistic employees and the strengths of these employees, helped them view autistic people as part of their ingroup. This study linked contact theory and ingroup bias theory to explain how high-quality contact may be associated with perceiving autistic people as part of one’s ingroup.…",

Measures of adaptive functioning collected through public health surveillance may provide valuable information on functioning and support needs at a population level. We aimed to use adaptive behavior and cognitive scores abstracted from health and educational records to describe trends over time in the population prevalence of autism by adaptive level and co‐occurrence of intellectual disability (ID). Using data from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, years 2000 to 2016, we estimated the prevalence of autism per 1000 8‐year‐old children by four levels of adaptive challenges (moderate to profound, mild, borderline, or none) and by co‐occurrence of ID. The prevalence of autism with mild, borderline, or no significant adaptive challenges increased between 2000 and 2016, from 5.1 per 1000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6–5.5) to 17.6 (95% CI: 17.1–18.1) while the prevalence of autism with moderate to profound challenges decreased slightly, from 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2–1.7) to 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.4).

This scoping review examines the cultural adaptations, facilitators, and barriers to the implementation of Caregiver Skills Training, focusing on its accessibility, feasibility, and acceptability. A comprehensive search of ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified eligible studies that reported cultural or linguistic adaptations of Caregiver Skills Training. Forward searches and manual reference checks supplemented the review. Data were extracted using the Cultural Adaptation Checklist framework and analyzed for patterns in adaptation, training, barriers, and facilitators. Seventeen studies across Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America highlighted diverse adaptations in language, content, and delivery methods. Facilitators included community partnerships and task-shifting with non-specialists, while barriers involved logistical challenges, stigma, and resource constr…"

Two hundred forty-two autistic ( n = 148) and non-autistic adults ( n = 94) completed a survey measuring trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity and post-trauma appraisals. Exposure to types of traumatic events did not differ significantly between the groups, but the autistic group endorsed more events that ‘happened to me’ directly.

An important aspect of the experience of females with ADHD is the impact of the menstrual cycle and ovarian hormones on both the symptoms of ADHD and effects of stimulant medications on treating these symptoms. Method: In the present pilot study, female participants being treated with amphetamine salts for ADHD ( n = 30) were recruited to complete 35 daily online surveys to track ADHD symptoms, mood, and medication use through the menstrual cycle. Results: Results indicated that the degree of ADHD symptoms was significantly associated with menstrual cycle phase with ADHD symptoms being most severe in the menstruation phase and comparatively milder ADHD symptoms in the mid-follicular phase. This difference was positively correlated with subjective changes in negative mood. Conclusion: These results indicate that ADHD symptoms vary across the menstrual cycle among females being treated with amphetamine salts for their ADHD, a finding that could inform clinical and prescribing practices for physicians caring for females with ADHD."

We conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial to understand whether oral CBD oil containing terpenes can improve outcomes in autistic children. Twenty‐nine children (18 male), aged 5 to 12 years ( M = 9.62 years, SD = 2.05), diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, completed the study. Participants received weight‐based dosing of CBD oil (10 mg/kg/day) or matched placebo oil over two 12‐week intervention periods (crossover), separated by an 8‐week washout period. Outcome measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale‐2 (SRS‐2; primary outcome), PROMIS Social Relating, Anxiety, and Sleep, Developmental Behavior Checklist‐2 (DBC‐2), Vineland‐3, and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI; secondary outcomes). There was no significant effect observed for the primary outcome measure (SRS‐2) for CBD oil relative to placebo oil after 12 weeks ( β = −11.15, SE = 7.19, p = 0.125).

Typically developing children's ability to understand that one may hide their emotion would be acquired before false belief understanding in children with ASD (e.g., Peterson and Wellman 2019), but with contradictory results (e.g., Zhang et al. 2016). In the current work, we aim to determine whether the order of acquisition of ToM‐related concepts in ASD differs, using methodological improvements compared to previous studies. Our results support the conclusion of a non‐deviant developmental trajectory for ToM in individuals with ASD, with a general ability to understand hidden emotions that is not mastered before false belief attribution.",

Caregivers of 45 young autistic children (70.7 ± 23.3 months) and those of 36 neurotypical peers (59.2 ± 11.8 months) carried a mobile device for 7 days to repeatedly record their child's social interactions and in‐the‐moment anxiety. They also completed the Social Responsiveness Scale‐2 and the Theory of Mind Inventory‐2 to evaluate their child's severity of autistic symptoms and ToM abilities. Multilevel analyses found that young autistic children with higher ToM abilities were more likely than those with lower abilities to interact with peers (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01–1.23) but also experienced more anxiety during interactions with both peers and adults (OR = 1.36, 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12–1.67, 1.01–1.63). In contrast, no significant associations between ToM and social interactions or anxiety were found in the neurotypical group. This study highlights the critical role of ToM abilities in the real‐life social engagement of autistic children and emphasizes the importance of understanding real‐time subjective social experiences.",

The economic impact of autism is significant. One intervention found to be efficacious is social skills training (SST); however, there are few economic studies of SSTs. This study addresses the dearth of cost analyses of SSTs in the literature. An ingredients method was used, with cost data collected through informant interviews, program budgets, and the E$timator Tool Kit . Results revealed the SST implementation cost was lower than other autism-focused Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions; families bear the largest proportion of costs; and optimizing personnel-heavy interventions like SST may be possible through high-quality, intensive training of lower wage personnel by experienced trainers who also provide ongoing support and supervision."

From an autistic perspective we explore neurotypical heterosexual neuromixed love stories and autistic counter love stories focusing on how neurotypical and autistic characters are represented. Our main findings are two dichotomies and two happy endings. In neurotypical heterosexual neuromixed love stories, the dichotomy of a female autistic grotesque and the male neurotypical savior is central where the happy ending is curing or masking autism, upholding both heteronormativity and neuronormativity. In autistic counter love stories, the happy ending is rather framed as unmasking and founding a way of life outside of neuro- and heteronormativity for both parties.

We leveraged unidimensional item response theory graded response models and a sample of 735 children to analyze the differential item functioning (DIF) of items within ADOS Module 3. Three items showed significant signs of racial bias: A1 (overall language level), A5 (offers information), and D5 (compulsions and rituals). On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and the impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0–48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. This analysis suggests a small but d…"

These findings emphasize the need of enhancing on‐campus social connections to reduce perceived discrimination among ASD children, thereby mitigating aggressive behaviors, and highlight the necessity of fostering a…",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is scarce evidence on how families of autistic children in Sweden create and sustain everyday routines that are meaningful to their goals and values, congruent with all family members’ needs and interests, and fit with the existing resources. This study explored sustainability of daily routines and patterns of accommodations in families of autistic preschool-aged children with or without intellectual disability from culturally, ethnically, and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Eleven parents participated in semi-structured, ecocultural family interviews (EFI). Researchers used the EFI codebook to rate the intensity of family accommodation activities and sustainability of their daily routines, and then conducted a thematic analysis of the results. Findings show that families’ accommodation activities varied in intensity in multiple ecocultural domains – from low levels to high – depending on available resources and children’s needs. For the majority of families, irrespective of their cultural background, three overarching themes of family accommodations were identified: (1) mother involvement and commitment; (2) being socially isolated; and (3) importance of public…",

The Screening and Linkage to Services for Autism (SaLSA) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02374541) demonstrated that autism family navigation (AFN) improved the likelihood that young children at risk for ASD completed a diagnostic evaluation. In a qualitative descriptive study, we recruited parent participants, health care and EI providers and staff, and project personnel from the SaLSA trial to participate in semi-structured interviews on acceptability and feasibility of AFN services for families seen in urban safety-net clinical settings (i.e., where care is provided regardless of ability to pay). Iterative theme analysis was performed. A community focus group was conducted for triangulation to improve validity. Results demonstrated four main themes: (1) “It’s all in a name: the risk of engagement”; (2) “Community partnerships require authentic trust”; (3) “System interactions and interrelationships”; and (4) “What is an autism family navigator: f…",

Yet, to date, most research exploring the effects of the virtual-representational-abstract (VRA) instructional sequence has been conducted in researcher-implemented settings. However, to ensure researchers are able to provide accurate practice recommendations, more research is needed to explore the teacher implementation of this intervention. The purpose of this concurrent multiple probe across participants single-case design study was to examine the effects of a teacher-implemented VRA instructional sequence taught via explicit instruction on the accuracy with which three elementary students with ASD solve addition with regrouping problems. The VRA instructional sequence involved the use of virtual base ten blocks, drawings, and abstract numerical strategies to solve addition with regrouping problems. Researchers found a functional relation between the VRA instructional sequence and student accuracy. All three students were also able to maintain their accuracy after intervention ended. The teacher was able to implement the VRA instructional sequence after only two…",

      "abstract": "Autistic individuals face increased risk during police interactions in the United States, including injury and death. Research shows police behave inequitably during interactions with marginalized communities and may behave even more inequitably toward individuals with multiple minoritized identities. Many autistic people also identify as gender diverse. However, it is largely unknown if or how autistic adults’ perceptions of police differ by gender identity. We examined autistic adults’ perceptions of policing, autism, and gender using an online questionnaire. Results revealed significant differences across gender groups (cis women, cis men, gender diverse) in perceptions of justice, comfort in disclosing diagnosis, helpfulness of diagnostic disclosure, influence of gender, and concern that one’s autistic traits would be misperceived as dangerous. These findings align with widespread calls for police reform and suggest current policing practices likely do not meet the needs of all autistic individuals, particularly autistic cis women and gender diverse individuals, who are more likely to report their gender has influenced police interactions and more concerned that their autistic…",

Symptoms can include paralysis, tremors, sensory disturbance, vision loss and dizziness. Functional neurological disorder exists at the complex intersection of physical and mental health, neurology and psychiatry, and body and mind. Despite a recent resurgence in clinical and scientific interest, functional neurological disorder has lagged behind other causes of neurological symptoms in research, service development and acceptance. The nature of the association between autism and functional neurological disorder remains uncertain, but several plausible mechanisms can be identified from overlapping areas of research, highlighting endogenous factors such as atypical interoception, motor function, emotional processing and sensorimotor integration, alongside exogenous influences including adversity, healthcare inequality and stigma.

While previous research has focused on virtual reality–based social skills training, little is known about how autistic people experience social interactions in virtual reality. We interviewed 22 autistic young people (aged 9–22 years, M Age = 14.5) after they engaged in a social interaction with a stranger in immersive virtual reality. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we found that participants generally found virtual reality interactions tolerable, engaging and helpful as a low-pressure first step towards more challenging social situations. Virtual reality was valued for reducing sensory overload, increasing confidence and offering novel social opportunities. However, participants did not view virtual reality as a replacement for in-person interaction, which they saw as essential for building meaningful relationships.

Eighteen school-age and adolescent autistic male participants, 14 males with fragile X syndrome + autism, and their mothers participated in the study.

Method: We retrospectively analyzed data from 440 psychiatric outpatients aged 10–19 years (ADHD: n = 137; non-ADHD: n = 303) who visited a university hospital between 2023 and 2025. Mind-wandering was assessed using the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ). Group differences in MWQ scores were examined using analysis of covariance, controlling for age, sex, Autism-Spectrum Quotient, and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. Additional analyses compared ADHD-only with ADHD plus autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comorbidity, and hierarchical regression was conducted to determine the independent contribution of ADHD to mind-wandering. Results: Adolescents with ADHD reported significantly higher MWQ scores than those without ADHD ( p &lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 0.92), and this difference remained significant after covariate adjustment (η² = 0.098).

      "abstract": "Objective: To examine whether children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can produce attentional orienting in response to gaze cues, and to identify which type of attentional orienting is impaired and why. Method: Two experiments employed a gaze cue–target paradigm using inhibition of return (IOR) as an indicator of exogenous attentional orienting. Experiment 1 used normal upright gaze faces as cues. Experiment 2 used inverted gaze faces as cues. Results: When normal gaze faces were used as the gaze cue, no IOR effect was observed in children with ADHD (Experiment 1); whereas when inverted gaze faces were used as the gaze cue, the IOR effect was produced in children with ADHD (Experiment 2). Conclusion: These results indicated that the ability to produce exogenous attentional orienting to the gaze cue is impaired in children with ADHD and that this impairment resulted from their reduced ability to exogenously orient to the intact face. These findings provide new evidence of social cognitive deficits and attentional orienting deficits in children with ADHD, and help provide support for children in educational settings."

      "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of exercise on hyperactivity/impulsivity, inhibitory control, and inhibition-related event-related potential (ERP) components in individuals with ADHD. Method: A systematic search identified relevant studies, and methodological quality was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), with data analysis conducted using Stata software. Results: A total of 36 studies (38 comparisons) were included, comprising 10 acute and 26 chronic exercise interventions. Exercise yielded a small-to-moderate improvement in inhibitory control but showed no significant effects on hyperactivity/impulsivity or inhibition-related N2 and P3 components. Subgroup analyses of inhibitory control revealed significant moderating effects of age (children/adolescents), intervention type (chronic interventions), frequency (three sessions per week), control condition (sedentary or no-intervention groups), and study quality (studies with moderate or high risk of bias). Conclusion: Exercise enhances inhibitory control in individuals with ADHD, with the effe…"

However, the specific co-occurrence patterns of ADHD symptoms and different functions of aggression remain unclear, as does their relationship with parenting practices. This study used a person-centered approach to examine the co-occurrence patterns of ADHD symptoms, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression and their associations with parenting practices. Method: A total of 1,152 mother-adolescent dyads participated in this study (adolescents: M age = 14.29; 48.0% girls). Latent profile analysis was conducted to identify adolescent profiles of ADHD, reactive, and proactive aggression, followed by multinomial logistic regression to examine relationships between these profiles and auxiliary variables. Results: Latent profile analysis identified three patterns of adolescent- and mother-reported ADHD symptoms, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression: low symptom (84.4%), reactive co-occurrence (10.0%), and complete co-occurrence (5.6%).

These two types of MW are also differentially associated with affective well-being. Most existing studies in ADHD, however, mainly rely on retrospective reports of MW tendencies, which are susceptible to memory-related errors and biases. Further, most studies categorise participants based on overall levels of ADHD, instead of accounting for the spectrum and dimensional heterogeneity of ADHD, including inattention and hyperactivity symptom dimensions. Our study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between different types of MW and affective well-being, across different symptom dimensions of ADHD. Methods: We used ecological momentary assessment to capture participants’ momentary attention state (on-task, intentional MW, or unintentional MW) and affective valence, six times daily for 7 days. Using linear mixed-effects modelling to account for inter-individual variance, we tested whether inattention and hyperactivity symptom dim…"

This study examined the incidence, sociodemographic risk factors and co-occurrence conditions of ASD, including categorization by ID, using national registers. Methods This study included singletons born in Finland between 1998 and 2015 who had been diagnosed with ASD by 2018, with cases categorized into ASD with ID and ASD without ID. We divided the study sample into four birth cohorts (1998–2002, 2003–2007, 2008–2011 and 2012–2015) to analyze changes in incidence over time. Cases ( n = 10,171) were matched with controls ( n = 49,391) by age, gender, and birthplace. Associations between sociodemographic risk factors and ASD were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Co-occurrence with other psychiatric disorders was examined only in the oldest cohort (1992–2002). Results The cumulative incidence of ASD without ID increased from 0.52 to 0.89% by age 10, while ASD with ID remained stable at 0.17%.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT At least 50% of autistic people experience clinically relevant anxiety symptoms. However, reasons for elevated rates of anxiety in autism remain poorly understood and there is a high unmet need for novel and adapted therapies for anxiety that are accessible to autistic people. This study aimed to establish the feasibility of a novel app‐based anxiety management tool (“Molehill Mountain”) that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people. A single‐centre, single‐arm feasibility study design was employed, whereby autistic people (≥ 16 years) with mild‐to‐severe symptoms of anxiety were recruited to a 13‐week intervention period (King's College London, UK; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05302167). Of 123 prospective participants screened, 100 (81%) participants aged 16–74 years ( n = 69 female) were enrolled within approximately 15 months. n = 76 (76%) completed an anxiety measure at ~15 weeks (Generalized Anxiety Disorder—7 Item Scale; GAD‐7). Most adhered to the full intervention duration: 65% ( n = 47), with most using the app weekly (1–6 days per week; 58%). 73% of participants agreed that they found the app easy to use overall and that an app is a good for…",

      "abstract": "Best practices in early intervention include empowering parents to embed evidence-based practices within regular routines with their child, such as Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs). However, very little research has explicitly evaluated intervention approaches that may lead to increased parent self-efficacy for parents of young children with autism. The current study is a mixed-methods evaluation of parent self-reported self-efficacy and perceptions following an NDBI that included strength-based video feedback coaching. We explored (a) parent perceptions of the intervention using a social validity questionnaire and (b) parent self-efficacy using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All parents rated the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention favorably with strong probability of the parents continuing the intervention in the home. While pre-post results were approaching significance, no statistically significant differences on parent self-efficacy ratings were present ( z = -1.841; p = .066). Parent responses to open-ended questions revealed that video feedback allowed parents to observe the successes of their child in ways that were not po…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Motor impairments are pervasive in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with atypical gait patterns often observed but understudied in early development. The aim of this pilot study was to analyze spatiotemporal gait parameters and variability in toddlers with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) peers. Methods The study included 12 ASD and 9 TD male toddlers, aged 18–30 months, walking independently. We extracted spatiotemporal gait parameters from laboratory recordings of walking. Gait variability was assessed via coefficients of variation for each parameter. Group differences were tested and exploratory correlations between gait parameters and motor skills were assessed. Results Results indicated increased gait variability in the ASD group across parameters, suggesting less consistent motor control. Significant differences in variability were observed in stride length, step length, stance time, and stride time. Conclusion This pilot study confirms that an objective assessment of gait is feasible in toddlers with ASD. Future research is needed to replicate the results in a larger sample, to explore underlying neurological mechanisms, as well as the impact of atyp…",

They reported their training and practices in DBDM and the variables they perceived to facilitate and inhibit data collection, graphing, and data-based decision-making. Teachers reported minimal training in DBDM. While some frequently collect data, methods and frequency of data interpretation for instructional decisions vary. Teachers identified time as the biggest barrier to DBDM. Despite recognizing its importance, teachers lack tools to meet accountability standards, highlighting the need for preservice training and ongoing support. Research is warranted on efficient and effective methods for training teachers of students with autism or intellectual disability to engage in DBDM in their classrooms.",

With respect to high secure psychiatric care (HSPC), a 2017 survey examining the experiences of autistic patients found most reported both positive and negative aspects associated with their care, and variable quality of life (QoL) ratings. Since this, several significant changes have occurred including moving to a new hospital site, the introduction of the mandatory Oliver McGowan autism awareness training and the national strategy for autistic children, young people and adults outlining the need to improve autistic individuals’ experience of the criminal justice system.

      "abstract": "Abstract Caregiving for children with Down syndrome (DS) is a long-term responsibility that often results in significant stress and anxiety for family caregivers. It is essential to comprehensively understand caregivers’ stressors and coping strategies to develop effective stress reduction interventions and policies. Despite existing research, there is a lack of comprehensive qualitative studies that collectively explore these aspects. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-synthesis of 58 qualitative and mixed-methods journal articles, focusing on the persistent stressors faced by caregivers and the coping mechanisms they use to mitigate stress. In addition to stress and coping, this synthesis captures the emotional experiences associated with the caregiving journey. This synthesis provides valuable insights for developing targeted stress-reduction interventions and caregiver support programs. Implications for practice, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed."

      "abstract": "Purpose The current report aims to provide indicators of parenting stress and coping behaviours across five diverse countries (Bangladesh, Greece, Kenya, UK, Zambia). It was hoped that the use of a single procedure would provide needed data from low-to-middle-income countries, in comparison to the better-studied higher-income countries. Design/methodology/approach In total, 200 parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 40 in each country) completed a series of scales about their parenting stress and coping styles. Findings The results suggested more similarities than differences. Parenting stress was high in all countries, and the highest was in the UK. Pessimism was also high in low-to-medium-income countries, and lower in Greece and the UK. Passive appraisal was used most often as a coping style, with mobilising the family being used more than social support. Cross-country, the only difference was that the UK parents used seeking spiritual support less than parents from other countries. Coping styles did not mediate the relationship between either ASD severity or behavioural problems and parenting stress. Originality/value These data suggest a degree of s…",

      "abstract": "Purpose Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to have lower adaptive functioning scores than their peers, which is the ability of one to care for themselves and communicate well with others. Previous research has established that lower adaptive functioning scores in children with ASD can be partially influenced by the presence of chaos in the home. To better understand how chaos may affect adaptive functioning, this study aims to establish whether parental worry mediated the link between chaos in the home and the adaptive functioning (communication, daily living skills, socialization) of children with ASD compared to those without ASD. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 202 parents, 99 with a child with ASD and 103 without ASD. Parents responded to the Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale, asking about the chaos level in their home. They also completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3 caregiver survey). Findings Correlations were found between chaos levels and adaptive functioning, with more chaos predicting decreases in adaptive functioning overall.

This study explored predictors of two categories of self-injurious behaviors that were delineated based on their potential for physical injury (self-injurious behavior-High Likelihood and self-injurious behavior-Low Likelihood), with a focus on the role of distress linked to a strong preference for routines (otherwise known as insistence on sameness). The sample included 1892 autistic youth (M age = 10.82, SD age = 4.14; 22% females) across the United States. Distress associated with insistence on sameness was the strongest predictor of total self-injurious behavior scores, self-injurious behavior-Low Likelihood, and self-injurious behavior-High Likelihood, after controlling for demographic factors and speech level, and remained a unique predictor after accounting for variance explained by other restricted and repetitive behaviors. Sensory hypersensitivity and sensory-seeking were strong unique predictors of all self-injurious behaviors, while hyposensitivity was a weaker predictor of self-injurious behavior total and self-injurious behavior-Low Likelihood, and a non-…"

Claudin-5, β-catenin and paxillin are important molecules with different roles in this barrier. Alterations in these molecules may disrupt the neurodevelopmental process by affecting various critical processes in the developing brain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether the peripheral levels of these molecules differ in children and adolescents with ADHD. Method: A total of 90 patients with ADHD aged between 8 and 18 years and 60 healthy controls were included in this study. The severity of ADHD symptoms was determined with the Atilla Turgay Scale. Child Anxiety-Depression Scale-Revised was completed to evaluate additional psychiatric problems of the patients. Serum levels of biochemical parameters were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: Serum claudin-5 levels were significantly lower and β-catenin levels were significantly higher in the ADHD group compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference in paxillin serum levels between the groups. Conclusion: This study suggests that claudin-5 and beta-cate…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Routine developmental screening is essential for early identification of autism. Reliable autism screening is even more valuable for individuals from minoritized groups who are often under-detected and receive later diagnoses. Despite this importance, disparities in access to screening and accurate identification persist. Given these disparities, we were interested in examining group differences in autism screening rates at 18 and 24 months of age among children referred to Georgia’s Part C Babies Can’t Wait (BCW) program between 2018 and 2022. Method Among a sample of 52,282 infants and toddlers enrolled in BCW, as hypothesized males and children with private insurance had higher screening likelihoods compared to females and children with public insurance. Results Unexpectedly, Black and Hispanic children were more likely to be screened than their counterparts. To examine this further, an examination of screening timing revealed that White and male children were more likely to be screened before their referral to BCW compared to peers. Conclusion This reveals continued inequities in screening timing but suggests that BCW providers serve an important role in identi…"

This study compared tele-assessment using the TAP-P to in-person autism assessment. Methods Participants were 116 children (aged 36–71 months) referred for autism evaluation. Participants first completed in-home tele-assessment (administration of the TAP-P, clinical interview, and Developmental Profile 4). All participants then completed in-person assessment with a different psychological provider, including cognitive or developmental assessment, adaptive behavior assessment, and autism-focused assessment (ADOS-2).

Amplified by autistic identity contingencies that shape how autistic identity is judged and treated in social contexts, these factors drive social camouflage in autistic adults, compelling them to conceal autistic characteristics for adapting to non-autistic groups, often resulting in negative mental health outcomes. This study proposes a novel autistic identity contingencies model to explore how autism acceptance and loneliness mediate the relationship between ableist microaggressions and social camouflage. An online survey of 330 autistic adults was conducted, followed by hierarchical multiple regression and chain mediation analyses. Results revealed that, ableist microaggressions positively predicted three social camouflage phenotypes: compensation, masking, and assimilation, with loneliness also positively predicting assimilation. Furthermore, after controlling for personal attributes, general stress and mental health conditions, lower external autism acceptance and higher loneliness mediated the positive relationship between ableist microaggressions and assimilation, wh…",

Furthermore, co-occurring trait-level autism and transgender and gender-diverse identity are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and autistic adolescents who identify as transgender and gender diverse have more internalizing behaviors than both non-transgender and gender-diverse autistic adolescents and non-autistic transgender and gender-diverse adolescents. However, no study has yet examined the extent to which transgender and gender-diverse identity predicts specific co-occurring mental health diagnoses in autistic adolescents. In a sample of 9027 autistic adolescents aged 13 to 17 drawn from the Simons Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort, 36 of whom we identified as transgender and gender diverse, we estimated univariate models of transgender and gender-diverse identity as a predictor of individual diagnoses. Depression, but no other diagnosis, remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. In a multiple regression model that incorporated known risk factors for adolescent depression (e.g. language impairment and disturbed sle…",

Our aim was to investigate the recording of autism in the records of autistic adults admitted to English general hospitals, time trends, and predictors of clinicians recording autism. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used routinely collected health data. We identified a cohort of adults with diagnosed autism who accessed mental health services and linked these with records of admissions to English general hospitals. We measured whether clinicians recorded autism in each admission. We calculated the proportion of admissions in which clinicians recorded autism for each year between 2007 and 2023. We used regression models to identify factors associated with the likelihood that clinicians documented autism during the admission. Results: In total, 4182 autistic adults together had 20,184 admissions. Admission level sensitivity of autism recording was 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI:] 37.1%−38.5%).

There is good discussion of the value of blog data, but with limited direction from blog authors themselves. This study aims to hear about the everyday experiences and motivations of autistic authors when they blog. Design/methodology/approach A systematic search and reflexive thematic analysis details the intentions of 43 autistic bloggers as described within blogs themselves. Findings Blogging created meaningful routes to belonging, feeling “connected but safe”. Blogs provided well-being resources for use personally (for reflection, self-acceptance and emotional expression) and to support peers. Bloggers also said they wrote to re-narrate how autism is understood by their readers, to speak with honesty without secret-keeping and to challenge stigma. Personal accounts chronicled and explained past pains caused by navigating what it means to be autistic. Blogs contained non-stigmatised and personally meaningful descriptions of autistic experiences, which the authors said were not available in other published sources.

This study aims to provide the first prevalence estimates of ASD in Georgia by evaluating its occurrence among 8–10 years old children. Design/methodology/approach Using a two-phase, population-based approach, the study screened third-grade students aged 8–10 years during 2019–2020 and conducted diagnostic assessments in 2020–2021. Screening tools included the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Diagnostic assessments used standardized measures such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-II, Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, Fourth Edition, Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II, supplemented by speech, language and communication tests. Screening data were obtained for 16,348 children (72.3% response rate; 50.1% females), with full diagnostic evaluations for 300 (mean age = 10.2 years; 31.7% females).

This study examined how newspaper reading preferences relate to public attitudes towards autism. A sample of 277 UK-based non-autistic adults completed an online survey reporting demographic information, newspaper reading habits (print or online) and trustworthiness ratings for 10 major British newspapers. Participants also completed measures of autism-related knowledge and explicit attitudes towards autism, and an implicit bias task. Data were analysed using generalized additive models weighted by newspaper exposure, along with hierarchical partitioning to estimate the variance explained by reading preferences and other factors. Newspaper-related factors accounted for 4.5% of the variance in explicit attitudes and 10.7% in implicit attitudes. Crucially, selective engagement with right-leaning tabloids was associated with more negative implicit attitudes. Furthermore, selective trust in these outlets predicted relatively favourable explicit but relatively negative implicit attitudes. Overall trust in newspapers was also linked to less accurate autism…",

This calls into question the generalizability of research findings derived from predominantly White, English-speaking samples. In this article, we bring forth an important argument about why we as an autism field should work to expand representation in research samples. We also discuss strategies that can be used to work toward this goal. We detail the recruitment and retention of 94 Spanish–English bilingual Latinx (primarily Mexican and Central American) families from low-income households across a large urban city and its surrounding communities in the United States for an assessment validation study. We use the method of this study as an example of how to engage and include underrepresented populations in autism research, describing the efforts that were implemented to engage families and community-based organizations serving this population. We conclude the report by summarizing culturally sensitive strategies researchers can use to engage populations of different races and ethnicities from low-income households in their own research studies, in…"

Methods: In this study, we drew from a nationally representative sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of ~1,400 middle to older adults ( M age = 66.9, SD = 8.4; 41.4% male; 60.7% White) who completed a set of cognitive measures and an ADHD symptomatology questionnaire in the 2016 Wave of the HRS. A multigroup path model was run by examining the association between self-reported ADHD symptom subscale scores for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity as well as self-reported depressive symptoms and cognitive outcomes across three groups: middle age, young-old, and middle-old. Results: Inattention symptoms were significantly associated with Serial 7s and Immediate Recall, however the constrained model was the best fitting model, suggesting no differences in the associations between self-reported inattention symptoms and cognitive outcomes by age. Conclusion: These results are consistent with previous work on the links between ADHD symptoms and c…"

      "abstract": "This study examined how parents of children with and without an autism diagnosis respond to their children’s negative emotions. Specifically, we (1) compared levels of supportive, non-supportive, and distress reactions; (2) tested whether child characteristics (autism traits and emotion dysregulation) predicted parent responses; and (3) explored whether autism diagnosis moderated these associations. Participants were 1780 parents of 2- to 5-year-old children from the United States (812 with an autism diagnosis). Parents completed the Coping with Children’s Negative Emotions Scale and reported on children’s autism traits and emotion dysregulation. Results indicated that parents of autistic children reported slightly more supportive and less non-supportive and distress responses than parents of children without a diagnosis. Associations between child characteristics and parent responses differed by diagnostic group: parents of children without a diagnosis who had more autism traits reported more non-supportive and distress responses, while these associations were weaker or non-existent for parents of children with a diagnosis. Emotion dysregulation was also associated with parent res…",

We used a Realist Evaluation approach to explore key contexts affecting neuro-affirming practice. A preliminary programme theory of key aspects of support was developed. Views on current practice were sought through structured interviews with 32 senior professionals in leadership roles within Health and Social Care services in Scotland. This study identified important contexts shaping the implementation of neuro-affirming practice for adults. Results indicate widespread professional support for modifying practice to better accommodate neuro-affirming ideas, and scope to achieve this. However, some contexts, including limited resources, restrictive eligibility criteria and rigid service structures, hinder progress. Growing demand for services was often viewed as a restrictive context, but it also offered a chance to rethink conventional, one-size-fits-all models and adopt neuro-affirming approaches. The study is important in addressing a current gap in research into professional…"

Results indicated that procrastination and irregular sleep schedules are significant barriers to academic success for both groups. Autistic students also report challenges related to their diagnosis, such as sensory concerns, difficulties with changes in routine, and apprehension over working with others. Despite these differences, both groups utilize similar compensatory strategies, such as summarizing readings and maintaining routines. Findings emphasize the necessity of interventions targeting procrastination and sleep habits for all students and additional supports provided for autistic students in the areas of socialization, group work, and postsecondary classrooms.",

Method: Eighty-five children with ADHD underwent 8 weeks of strictly monitored treatment. Forty children (8.2 ± 2.1 years old, nine girls) were randomly assigned to be treated with Jingling Oral Liquid (Liaoning Dongfangren Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), and 41 children (8.6 ± 2.5 years old, six girls) received placebo treatment. Results: Significant improvement was observed in the total score of ADHD rating scale (−4.8, 95% CI [−8.4, −1.1], p = .011) and in the hyperactivity/impulsivity score (−3.0, 95% CI [−4.8, −1.1], p = 0.002) for the Medicine group compared with the Placebo group, but not for inattention score (−1.9, 95% CI [−4.0, 0.2], p = 0.078). No significant changes were observed in the physiological indicators of the children pre- and post-treatment, and no definite drug-related adverse reactions were reported. Conclusion: Jingling Oral Liquid has shown efficacy in managing ADHD, specifically targeting hyperactivity and impulsivity sy…"

Our analysis revealed a moderate and significant summary effect size for changes in eye‐tracking outcomes from pre‐ to post‐treatment (Hedge's g = 0.32, p = 0.010). Additionally, a moderate but non‐significant summary effect size was revealed for the correlation between baseline eye‐tracking outcomes and changes in developmental outcomes following treatment (Fisher's z = 0.20, p = 0.115), with moderation effects observed based on developmental domain and sex.

An increasing recognition of missed or misdiagnosed autistic adults is highlighted throughout the commentary. Recommendations for reducing barriers in diagnostic processes are reviewed, including improving existing adult autism measures and developing new ones, especially self‐report/interview tools capturing what cannot be externally observed; providing more information about the process ahead of time and better post‐diagnostic support; better assessment of psychosocial and mental health histories; training to promote clinicians' understanding of adult autism; and the importance of considering culture.

Moreover, FGIDs may affect feeding to jeopardize nutritional intake. Existing research often overlooks the heterogeneity of FGIDs. Understanding the clinical correlates of individual FGID subtypes may clarify the underlying gut‐brain interactions to guide management. This study compared the core autistic symptoms, co‐occurring psychopathologies, feeding behavior and dietary intake among 737 Chinese children with autism (mean age = 7.76 years; 642 males and 95 females) who either experienced no FGID or experienced one of the three subtypes of ROME‐IV FGID. FGIDs were present in 19.8% of participants and MANCOVA revealed distinct clinical profiles across FGID subtypes. Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) were associated with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, including restricted and repetitive behavior, anxiety, sensory hyperresponsiveness, externalizing behavior, and feeding patterns of emotional under‐eating, slowness in eating, and increased satiety response.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Autism encompasses a wide range of developmental abilities. Notably, nearly 30% of children fail to achieve phrase speech by kindergarten, even when provided with years of early interventions or participation in rigorously conducted clinical trials. Our understanding of why these challenges persist is limited by an underrepresentation of minimally verbal (MV) children in autism research. Consequently, our understanding of benefits from early intervention is limited. There is promising evidence that minimally verbal autistic children may benefit from an adaptive approach that can address their dynamic needs. Adaptive interventions give service providers the ability to adjust strategies and approaches to match the needs of an individual. A critical component of an adaptive intervention approach is the ability to assess response to the intervention in order to make a decision on the best course of action. Previous work in identifying response to intervention has identified key predictors such as IQ, age, and expressive language ability. However, it may be helpful to examine core developmental skills as important variables driving decisions in adaptive intervention approaches.…",

      "abstract": "Compared with their non-licensed peers, licensed autistic adults appear to report more positive outcomes in objective measures of quality of life, particularly participation in activities outside of the home. We examined if this is due to individual differences/factors or the ability to independently drive. We conducted a prospective follow-up survey study of 16–21 years old in the United States and compared engagement in activities outside of the home over time by licensing status. Our final sample included 111 young adults; at follow-up, 62% did not have a permit or a license, 18% had obtained a permit, and 20% were licensed. Generally, travel patterns were consistent, except for reported increases in employment. The lack of overall differences across groups over time suggests individual differences in resources, barriers/facilitators to traveling, or general characteristics may underlie objective measures of quality of life rather than the obtainment of a license. Furthermore, regardless of licensure status, most respondents were not traveling everywhere they wanted to go, and nearly 80% were interested in a transportation modality they did not currently use. Thus, there is a co…",

      "abstract": "Objective: Inhibition is a critical executive function for stopping routine responses and facilitating planned behaviour. Although the results are mixed, individuals with ADHD are reported to have poorer inhibition performance; however, this remains a subject of ongoing debate. Findings in the literature suggest that the central executive component of working memory and resource allocation could play a role. The present study investigated whether varying maintenance demands would influence inhibition performance among children with and without ADHD. Materials and Methods: The study sample comprised 80 children aged between 7 and 11 years (60 males and 20 females; M age = 9.01). For the first time in the literature, participants completed a Go/no-go Task with four levels of gradually increased working memory load. The data was analysed using mixed repeated measures ANOVA. Results and Conclusion: A significant main effect of group, load and interaction were obtained. There was no significant difference in inhibition performance between the two groups when there was no working memory load. However, in the presence of a load, the ADHD group consistently scored lower across all load con…"

      "abstract": "Object: Temperament provides a valuable framework for understanding ADHD across the lifespan, as extreme temperamental traits are considered etiological risk factors. The dual-pathway model links specific temperamental traits to ADHD symptom domains: elevated reactive traits, surgency and negative affect, to hyperactivity/impulsivity, and a low regulatory trait, effortful control, to inattention. Method: One hundred fifty-eight adults (79 with clinical diagnoses of ADHD and 79 controls) filled in the Adult Temperament Questionnaire. Consistent with a compensatory extension of the dual-pathway model, it was hypothesized that effortful control would moderate the effects of reactive traits (surgency/negative affect) on hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and influence both ADHD symptom domains. For exploratory purposes, orienting sensitivity, an adult temperament factor related to perceptual sensitivity, was included in the analyses. Results: Binary logistic regression identified lower effortful control as the strongest predictor of an ADHD diagnosis. Negative affect had a significant but small effect, while surgency and orienting sensitivity were non-significant. Two hierarchical regressi…"

Studies seeking to explain discrepancies between the need for and use of ADHD services in AA &amp; NH/PI populations have highlighted decreased problem recognition as precluding access to services. We sought to investigate the roles of three previously proposed factors (i.e., perceived impairment, ADHD knowledge, and ADHD stigma) in explaining differences in ADHD problem recognition in AA &amp; NH/PI versus White, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Multiracial/Multiethnic college students. Method: Participants were 1,451 college students aged 18 to 29 years ( M = 19.3, SD = 1.64) who met self-reported symptom and impairment criteria for ADHD. They completed questionnaires assessing ADHD problem recognition, perceived impairment, ADHD knowledge, and ADHD stigma. Results: Compared to the White Group, the AA &amp; NH/PI Group had significantly lower probability of endorsing the belief that they should be diagnosed with ADHD. The AA…"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) groups, adjusted for autistic adults in an outpatient context. Methods: We conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled effectiveness trial during the years 2018–2020. Autistic adults ( N = 77) were recruited from outpatient services and randomized to either MBSR ( n = 39) or treatment as usual, TAU (i.e., continued regular services, n = 38). We used linear mixed models with random intercept to analyze the effects of intervention on self-rated perceived stress (primary outcome), as well as mental health, mindfulness skills, quality of life, and autism acceptance (secondary outcomes). In addition, we collected qualitative data at exit discussions in the MBSR groups and examined the transcription using thematic content analysis. Results: Participants (52% female) had a mean age of 40 years, with a majority being unemployed at the time of inclusion (64.9%) and having at least one co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis (87%).

Study 1 is a randomised controlled trial evaluating the ADHD Sleeping Sound © intervention to compare outcomes between in-person and telehealth modalities. Study 2 examined whether baseline sleep problems and treatment response were predicted by baseline symptom presentation, attachment security, and family functioning. Method: Children aged 5 to 12 years (65.4% male) with ADHD received either in-person ( n = 40) or telehealth ( n = 38) treatment. Subjective (Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire) and objective (actigraphy) sleep variables were assessed at baseline, post-intervention (1 week), and follow-up (3 months). Results: As expected, subjectively measured sleep disturbance significantly improved post-treatment, with no significant difference in rate of change between in-person and telehealth modalities. For Study 2, baseline measures comprised the Conners CBRS, Attachment Insecurity Screening Inventory, Security Scale, and Family Assessment Device.…"

We administered an anonymized, self‐report survey to 424 autistic and 345 non‐autistic adults through a convenience sampling framework. Binomial logistic regression models identified whether trauma and autism diagnosis were related to (i) self‐harm, (ii) suicide attempts, (iii) suicide plans, (iv) a mental health condition that impacts daily life, and (v) substance use to cope. Heatmaps were generated to identify traumas that frequently co‐occur with psychological distress and SRB. After accounting for trauma and demographic differences, autism remained a significant predictor of all outcomes, except whether individuals used substances to cope (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.54–1.12, p = 0.18). Autistic people were more likely to report self‐harm (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.85–4.00, p &lt; 0.01), suicide attempts (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.65–3.68, p &lt; 0.01), suicide plans (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.41–2.83, p &lt; 0.01), and experiencing a mental health condition that impacts daily life (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 2.42–5.33, p &lt; 0.01) than non‐au…",

Additionally, risk of suicidality is often found to increase with age in the general population. Despite this, suicidality has seldom been explored in autistic populations in midlife and old age. This study investigates the self-reported prevalence of self-harm and suicidality in autistic people in midlife and old age compared to an age- and gender-ratio comparable non-autistic group. Methods In total, 388 participants (autistic n = 222, 44% men) aged 40–93 years (mean = 60.9 years) from the AgeWellAutism study completed questionnaires related to experiences of suicidal ideation, self-harming thoughts, deliberate self-harm, and suicidal self-harm. Group, gender and age differences were examined in chi-square and linear regression analyses. Results The autistic group reported significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation, self-harming thoughts, deliberate self-harm, and suicidal self-harm than the non-autistic comparison group.

We used multilevel modeling to analyze Medicaid billing claims for 1,028 autistic youth under the age of 21 years to examine the extent to which there were disparities in hours of ABA services for Medicaid-enrolled youth based on race/ethnicity and rurality. Although younger children received more hours of ABA, F (1, 964.63) = 118.28, p &lt; .001, there were no statistically significant differences in hours of ABA based on minoritized race/ethnicity status or sex.

Previous work shows that, for autistic people, alexithymia, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and anxiety mediate the relationship between SP differences and RRB. However, these studies use anxiety measures developed for the general population, and more recent evidence suggests that autistic people may have a different anxiety experience. This study aims to extend previous findings by unpacking the anxiety experience for autistic adults in the relationship between SP differences and RRB, using an autism‐specific anxiety measure. Data were available from 426 autistic adults. Serial mediation models tested the relationship between SP differences and RRB, with alexithymia, IU, anxious arousal, and social anxiety as mediators. We identified significant direct effects from SP differences to both repetitive motor behaviors (RMB) and insistence on sameness behaviors (ISB). For RMB, we found indirect effects through anxious arousal, alexithymia‐anxious arousal, IU‐anxious arousal, and a…",

This study explored the association between prenatal exposure to air pollutants and the likelihood of developing autism, considering both autistic symptoms and diagnosed cases in a school-based population from Tarragona (Spain), a province with extensive petrochemical activity. Methods In the first phase, parents and teachers of 3,727 children (aged 4 and 11 years) completed screening questionnaires (CAST and EDUTEA, respectively). In the second phase, 623 children were individually assessed, and diagnoses were based on DSM-5 criteria (58 children with autism and 51 with subthreshold autistic traits). Results We performed multiple regressions, adjusting for individual, social, and family covariates. Significant associations were found between exposure to PM coarse (β-0.16; CI: 0.03–0.29), NO 2 (β-0.15; CI: 0.02–0.28), and NO x (β-0.18; CI: 0.03–0.34) and autism symptom scores reported by the teachers. Furthermore, a significant association suggests higher exposure to PM 2.5 (OR-1.66; CI: 1.03–2.65)…",

Instead of simply listing barriers, we set out to identify true, evidence-based strategies that could help patients and clinicians maximize long-term dedication to care. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed 52 peer-reviewed articles between 2014 and 2024. The primary sources used were five electronic databases (Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, and Taylor &amp; Francis). The studies included heterogeneous age groups—children, adolescents, and adults—and had diverse methodologies ranging from randomized controlled trials to qualitative interviews. Results: Adherence to treatment for ADHD remains a problem, especially among teenagers. We organized the influencing factors into five main areas: sociodemographic, psychological/clinical features, medication-related issues, beliefs and attitudes, and broader systemic or environmental challenges. Conversely, interventions like pharmacological strategies, digital interventions and mobile-based reminders, psychoeducational and behavioral approac…"

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Autism and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are each associated with increased psychiatric emergency department (PsyED) use, yet the service impact of coexisting autism–BPD remains unclear. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 1027 PsyED visits by 345 autistic adults (2018–2020) at an urban Canadian psychiatric hospital to compare service patterns between those with and without a BPD diagnosis. Sociodemographics, presenting reasons, restraint use, and disposition were analyzed using mixed‐effects logistic regression. BPD was documented in 33.5% of visits and in 11.0% of unique autistic individuals, more often in birth‐assigned females. Among all autistic individuals' PsyED visits, an autism diagnosis was documented in 60.2% of their text‐based charts. Furthermore, autism was documented less frequently when BPD was recorded, suggesting possible diagnostic overshadowing. Suicidality as the primary reason for visit was associated with documented BPD (OR 4.366, 95% CI 2.659–7.169; p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed in disposition (discharge vs. admission) or restraint use between birth‐assigned sex, BPD status, or documentation of autism withi…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Since COVID-19, tele-based methods of autism assessment have been relied upon to a previously unparalleled degree; however, the need for such advancements is not new. Observation-based measures are a crucial component of face-to-face autism diagnostic evaluations, but few validated observation tools exist for remotely assessing autism across childhood, offering minimal guidance for older children and adolescents. Sanchez and Constantino previously validated a brief, face-to-face, clinician-facilitated observation coded according to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2). During the pandemic, this measure was adapted as a remote observation, but has yet to be validated in this format. Methods The current study validated this remote observation against the in-person Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), in a sample of 30 children ages 1-16 years ( M = 7.25, SD = 4.05). Results The remote observation was highly correlated with the ADOS-2 ( r = .75, p &lt; .001) and Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition ( r = .74, p &lt; .001), and demonstrated acceptable sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (80%) in predicting resear…"

It shows how inclusive policies can capitalize on the special abilities of people with neurodiverse backgrounds, including their extraordinary problem-solving abilities, meticulous attention to detail and creative thinking. These policies benefit the individuals and contribute to a more diverse and innovative workplace. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected through semistructured interviews with HR experts and neurodivergent employees. The qualitative data were manually analyzed and coded, and themes were identified. Findings The results highlight the significant benefits of accepting neurodiversity in the workplace, enlightening the audience about its potential. For instance, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to anonymize resumes, removing potential biases related to gender, ethnicity or age. In addition, AI can help in identifying the unique skills and strengths of neurodivergent employees, enhancing the fit between job responsibilities and their abilities.

This study compared depot-specific adiposity between these groups. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis (December 2022–2024, Beijing Children’s Hospital) included 306 children (6–12 years) stratified into: ADHD + Obesity ( n = 65), obesity-only ( n = 77), and Control ( n = 164). Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance. Group comparisons for depot-specific adiposity and metabolic markers were performed using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI z -score. Results: The ADHD + Obesity group exhibited significantly greater visceral adiposity than the Obesity-only group, as reflected by a 16.84 cm 2 larger visceral fat area (VFA) and a 1.03 kg/m 2 higher fat mass index (FMI). The ADHD + Obesity group also showed a more adverse metabolic profile, including elevated liver enzymes and fasting glucose. Conclusion: Excess visceral adiposity represents a distinct phenotypic feature of ADHD + Obesity. These findings support the need for int…"

Few studies have compared FER across these groups. Methods To address this gap, we evaluated FER in 540 children and adolescents aged 8 to 16 years old autistic ( N = 80), ADHD ( N = 80), and SLD ( N = 80), compared to a control group (CG; N = 300), matched for age, sex and intelligence quotient. We used a FER task that varied in task type - matching (comparing whether two facial expressions convey the same or different emotions) vs. labeling (identifying the specific emotion depicted by a facial expression), emotions’ intensity (high vs. low), and type of emotion (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise).

These abilities encompass both narrative and non-narrative genres, each serving distinct communicative functions. Narrative discourse involves spoken accounts of events or experiences, typically with a setting, characters, and a sequence of actions. Non-narrative discourse includes genres like explanations, arguments, and descriptions that convey information or ideas without a temporal structure. The aim of this review was to synthesise extant literature on discourse abilities of children and adults with ADHD across these genres. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted via CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, and ProQuest. The review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO [CRD 42022377007]. Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in our review. Most studies investigated the narrative abilities of children with ADHD. ADHD was associated with atypical verbal output, characterised by atypical brevity and verbosity, dysfluency, reduced syntactic complexity, and grammatical errors.

For autistic people with multiple marginalized identities, the compounding effects of stigma based on race and disability may worsen peer attitudes. This study investigated first impressions of Black and White autistic adults made by non-autistic observers. Autistic adults ( N = 29) stratified by race (15 Black, 14 White) completed a videotaped semi-structured conversation, and non-autistic raters provided their first impressions of each participant. Black autistic people were rated as more likable and trustworthy, and raters endorsed a greater interest in interacting with them, compared to White autistic people. Evidence of intersectional effects of race, gender, and autism was also observed. White autistic men, but not Black autistic men, were evaluated less favorably than non-male autistic participants, with Black autistic men being evaluated more favorably on some items. These results suggest that the intersection of race and autism may, in some cases, counter stereotypes about Blackness and autism, and that holding multiple marginalized identities can modify…",

      "abstract": "Abstract The current review synthesises research exploring the views from autistic students about their experiences in mainstream education. Autistic students experience significantly higher rates of mental health difficulties compared with their neurotypical peers and are vastly overrepresented in permanent exclusions. Research has identified low sense of belonging as a common experience among excluded students; however, there remains a relative paucity of research exploring autistic students’ perspectives on their educational experiences. It is therefore important to undertake a review of research exploring autistic students’ views on the challenges of mainstream secondary school in order to identify the potential barriers to their sense of belonging and psychological wellbeing. Fourteen studies were critically appraised in relation to the review question, and an adapted version of thematic synthesis was utilised to synthesise the findings. Twelve descriptive themes emerged from the data, which were conceptualised into four analytical themes: ‘feeling unsupported and misunderstood by peers’, ‘experiencing sensory overload in the school environment’, ‘feeling inappropriately suppo…",

Design/methodology/approach A 52-month retrospective audit was conducted where all participants met diagnostic threshold for a CEN diagnosis, focusing on presence of ASD and gender identity. Additional comorbidities are reported. Findings In total, 553 referrals were assessed, a small number of whom identified as gender diverse (n = 23, 4.2%). A modest, significant correlation is reported between gender identity and ASD. Suggestions for potential aetiological considerations are briefly given, though further research on a larger scale should be undertaken to explore whether this correlation persists, and if so, potential factors leading to this. Originality/value The authors understand that this is the first study of its kind to explore this area of overlap of CEN, ASD and gender identity extending this past the male–female binary.",

In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators. In Phase 2, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the resulting training in a sample of 192 educators, grades K-12. Significant improvements were noted in educator knowledge and self-efficacy in pre- to post-assessments. Together, community-based participatory research and human-centered design provided a promising community-driven approach to deve…"

In a sample of 1757 Dutch autistic adults, 445 parents of autistic children and 126 legal representatives of autistic adults, we explored perspectives on genetics research. We used a pilot repeated survey, consisting of questions about the perceived importance of the heritability of autism, reasons for this importance and the desire to learn more about heritability. Over 95% of the participants found it at least a little important to know that autism is highly heritable, and 67% would like to learn more about it. Participants mentioned that they find it important to increase knowledge about the causes of autism, and to improve the diagnostic process. There were no substantial differences in perspectives between stakeholder groups. Contrasting previous work, this pilot study indicates support for genetics research in autism, which highlights diversity in community perspectives. It also identifies an unmet educational need.

Methods: A sample of assessed adults with ADHD ( N = 154; ages 18–55 years) were recruited to participate and randomized to either 8 weeks of use of the CBT-informed app or a waitlist control condition. Participants in both groups completed measures of ADHD symptoms and functioning at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks. Results: Linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements revealed significant group x time interactions for inattentive symptoms (η 2 = .15), hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (η 2 = .05), and ADHD associated quality of life (η 2 = .04) in favor of the CBT-informed app relative to participants who knew they were not receiving help; however, these results did not extend to a measure of functional impairment.

ADHD, closely intertwined with neurological development, often manifests as impairments within brain regions associated with memory, executive function, and emotion regulation. Nevertheless, the specific brain structural mediators linking SES to ADHD remain unclear. Method: We explored whether the brain surface area (SA) and thickness (TH) mediated the relationship between SES indicators (Townsend deprivation index at recruitment, average total household income before tax, and job involves heavy manual or physical work) and ADHD utilizing two-step Mendelian Randomization (MR) and multivariate MR method. Results: The MR analysis indicated that higher SES corresponds to a lower prevalence of ADHD. Genetically predicted household income was positively correlated with the SA of insula (β = .31, p = 1.02 × 10 −4 ), and physical work was positively correlated with the TH of entorhinal cortex (β = .74, p = 3.73 × 10 −5 ).

Data were analyzed descriptively and using mixed-effects modeling. More unmet service needs, more barriers to services, and a lower sense of community were associated with greater social communication impairment.

Therefore, there is a need for psychosocial support for this age group in a format and style that suits their preferences and needs. This article describes the emerging practice of an online music group with six autistic young women aged 20–24 in Indonesia. This group met weekly for 12 weeks and was facilitated by a qualified music therapist. We identified four themes using reflexive thematic analysis, including “eagerness to connect,” “sharing music and life stories,” “being with people who accept and affirm autistic people,” and “entering a supportive autistic community.” Learnings from this emerging practice suggest that an online music group could support identity formation and solidarity by offering these autistic young women the opportunity to see themselve…",

Across Strange Situation studies, secure classifications ranged 31.5%–59.0%, with disorganization frequently elevated relative to typical comparison groups. Caregiver sensitivity and insightfulness were associated with greater security; limited longitudinal evidence linked early security with later social inclusion and empathic concern.

This study aims to investigate the association between applied behavior analysis therapy and post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidality, mental health hospitalization rates, and length of mental health hospitalizations using a national database of privately insured youth under 18. We matched 17,120 autistic youth who received applied behavior analysis with a control group of autistic youth with no record of applied behavior analysis and clustered them into four applied behavior analysis dose groups using two-stage bisecting k-medians clustering. Then, we used negative binomial regression and logistic regression to compare outcomes for the applied behavior analysis and non-applied behavior analysis groups. Overall, applied behavior analysis receipt was associated with 30% higher odds of experiencing a mental health hospitalization (odds ratio = 1.30, p &lt; 0.001) and a 32% higher incidence rate of these hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio = 1.32, p &lt; 0.001). Our analysis found no relationship between applied behavior analysis dosing and the ot…"

      "abstract": "Research on ageing in autism has sharply increased following a number of influential publications that highlighted the lack of knowledge in this area. However, much of the research on autism ageing has inadvertently treated all people aged over 50 as a homogeneous ‘older adult’ group, overlooking important distinctions between midlife (40–64 years) and old age (65+ years). Midlife is marked by complex role management, career pressures, health changes and identity development, while old age often involves retirement, shifts in priorities, physical and cognitive changes, and planning for less independent living. Recognising midlife and old age as distinct life phases is essential to accurately characterise the lived experiences and needs of autistic adults across the latter part of the lifespan. This letter makes conceptual and methodological suggestions that autism researchers should align with established ageing frameworks by labelling samples accurately, using appropriate keywords and, where possible, stratifying analyses by age subgroup. Doing so will enhance research accuracy, improve indexing and increase clinical relevance. This shift is vital for advancing autism ageing resea…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Social media has increasingly become a platform where individuals share and seek information about autism. However, recent research indicates that autism-related content on TikTok often contains misleading or inaccurate information. Additionally, the number of adults seeking first-time autism diagnoses has increased over the past several years, potentially due to increased public awareness and exposure to content on social media. In order to understand how autistic adults are engaging with TikTok, there is a need to examine content focused specifically on autism in adulthood. This study aimed to address this gap by analyzing TikTok content associated with the hashtags #actuallyautistic, #latediagnosedautistic, and #autism. Methods A content analysis of 150 videos examined themes, attitudes, clinical accuracy, and user engagement metrics. Additional analyses were run to examine common traits that users reported in relation to autism. Results A significant portion of videos were either personal in nature or misleading. Content analysis showed that many topics centered around identity related to autism diagnosis, and many associated themes were negative. There were si…",

Despite growing interest in early identification, opportunities to collect and integrate diverse presymptomatic data remain limited. This study aimed to inform the design of an at-home assessment kit for collecting genetic and environmental data related to later autism diagnosis by interviewing interestholders about the acceptability and feasibility of such a kit. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 mothers or future mothers of children from groups associated with varying genetic and environmental factors related to later autism diagnosis. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis, including second cycle and axial coding. Results Seven primary themes emerged from the analysis: (a) willingness; (b) concerns; (c) supports; (d) research participation; (e) goals of research; and (f) impediments to research engagement.

While there is significant evidence that audiovisual (AV) integration is altered in the temporal domain in autism—and that these differences are associated with presentation of SCI and RRBIs—very little is known about how autistic individuals integrate AV information in the domain of space. Methods We conducted a free-response AV spatial localization task in autistic and non-autistic children aged 7–17 years to understand better AV localization abilities, as well as how these abilities relate to SCI, RRBIs, and other clinical features of autism. Results While we found no group differences in AV spatial performance, an exploratory analysis revealed three clusters of autism features that were significantly predictive of performance across groups: a motor/somatosensory cluster, a sensory responsivity cluster, and a social communication cluster.

By addressing the researcher’s relationship to power, both as a potential target and as a bearer of privilege, this tool resists the colonial impulse to claim objectivity, instead embracing shared authority and relational accountability. Each question serves as a provocation, prompting continuous reflection on the ethical complexities of knowledge creation while resisting appropriation and extractivist tendencies.

This study aims to address this problem. Methods We recorded eye movements from 34 children with ASD (6–16 y) and 40 age-matched typically developing (TD) peers while they viewed six picture sets that independently manipulated hue, luminance and saturation. Nine eye-movement metrics were extracted per task and analysed with mixed-effects ANOVAs; false-discovery-rate control (q = .05) and Holm–Bonferroni corrections were applied across 54 planned tests. Results Across all tasks, the ASD group showed a 29% reduction in total fixation time (F = 11.13, q &lt; .001; p Holm &lt; .001†), a 19% reduction in fixation count (F = 5.88, q = .027), and 42% fewer saccades (F = 16.06, q &lt; .001; p Holm &lt; .001†).

Best practice guidance suggests that generic inpatient units are poorly suited to many autistic patients. This meta-analysis synthesised the highly variable empirical literature reporting the prevalence of autistic people in such settings. Systematic searches of three databases were conducted, with eighteen studies included in the final review. The pooled estimated prevalence was 10% (95% confidence interval: 6–14%), compared to a 1% prevalence of autism in the general population. Significantly higher prevalence was estimated for children (13%) vs. adults (4%). A structured risk of bias assessment suggested that the quality of studies was highly variable. High levels of heterogeneity were explored statistically. Despite best practice guidelines stating that many autistic people would have their needs best met in specialty units, autistic people are over-represented in generic psychiatric inpatient settings.",

This mixed-methods study investigated the impact of clothing-related tactile hyper-sensitivity on autistic adults’ lives, focusing on appearance dissatisfaction, appearance awareness, self-esteem and self-expression through clothing. An online survey was completed by 86 autistic adults in the United Kingdom. Regression analysis revealed a significant predictive relationship between tactile hyper-sensitivity and appearance dissatisfaction. Moderation analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between tactile hyper-sensitivity and self-esteem, moderated by appearance dissatisfaction. Moderation of the relationship between appearance dissatisfaction and self-esteem by appearance awareness was not significant, but both appearance constructs were independent negative predictors of self-esteem. Three themes relating to the impacts of clothing-related tactile sensitivity were generated through thematic analysis of open-ended questions: ‘Negative consequences’, ‘Managing clothing-related tactile sensitivity’ and ‘T…",

Purposive sampling through social media was used to recruit 19 autistic adults aged 21–71 (11 women, 8 men) who self-reported heightened rejection sensitivity. Face-to-face or online semi-structured interviews were held. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was utilized to analyse the data, and synthesized member checking was conducted to ensure data accuracy. Participants described their rejection sensitivity as profoundly overwhelming, exhausting emotions and thoughts when anticipating or perceiving rejection and criticism. These responses could be accompanied by physical tension, pain and reliving past rejections. Its intensity varied greatly depending on contextual factors (e.g. baseline mood and topic of rejection) and was frequently invalidated. Identified predisposing factors included inherent autistic traits and lifelong rejection experiences. Many strategies were employed to alleviate these chal…",

Independent screening and study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and evaluation of the certainty of evidence were conducted.

Psychological behavioural therapies including visual pedagogies, social stories, components of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) and Applied Behavioural Analysis, as well as the use of smart device applications all demonstrated improvement in oral health parameters following implementation. However, most studies lacked control groups and exhibited a high risk of bias due to the lack of reporting or failure to account for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) severity and associated comorbidities. In addition, studies typically relied on caregivers to carry out reinforcement of therapies, which may explain the significant heterogeneity observed.

      "abstract": "Over half the world’s population are bilingual. Despite this, practitioners often advise parents of autistic children to teach their child one dominant national language and limit their child’s exposure to community languages. Limited research with autistic children’s carers has shown that this monolingual approach impoverishes children’s experiences in communal, familial, religious, and social contexts. There is very little research on this topic from the first-person perspectives of autistic children themselves. There is no research exploring the perspectives of Hebrew-English bilingual autistic children. This study aimed to explore the perspectives and experiences of autistic children on Hebrew-English bilingualism. In accord with the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) methodological framework, semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 13 Hebrew-English bilingual autistic children. The IPA clustering process resulted in two overarching group experiential themes (GETs). The first GET was ‘Bilingualism aids religious, educational, and social integration and connection’.

Using an online survey designed in consultation with autistic people, we examined reasons why autistic adults living in the United Kingdom did not seek help from the National Health Service (NHS) when they last experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviours. Participants who disaffirmed help-seeking from the NHS (n = 754) were able to select from a prepopulated list of 20 reasons why and to enter their own. The three most commonly endorsed reasons were ‘I tried to cope and manage my feelings by myself’, ‘I did not think they could help me’ and ‘The waiting list is too long – no point’. Endorsement of reasons differed significantly with gender identity, age group and degree of lifetime suicidality. Four themes emerged from analysis of free-form responses: NHS is ineffective , NHS as antagonistic, Fear and consequences and Barriers to access . These findings highlight the need to foster more flexible healthcare systems capable of supporting autistic people, and that autistic people view as trustworthy and effective, to enable help-seeking behaviou…",

      "abstract": "In recent years, genetic and genomic autism research has come under increasing scrutiny, moving to the center of debates about ableism, neurodiversity, autism acceptance, and the future of research and care. At the same time, both autism research and genetics and genomics research have, as fields, begun to reckon with the significance of the language researchers use in the course of their work and the harmful ideas that may thereby be reinforced. Although the language of research cannot be assumed to straightforwardly correspond to individual researchers’ beliefs, the presence of widespread ableist language may indicate structural and institutionalized ableism, including ableist assumptions at the foundations of research. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of 166 genetic and genomic autism research projects funded by the US National Institutes of Health, in order to understand the prevalence of potentially ableist discourse, language, and stigmatizing language about autistic people. We found that such discourse and language was ubiquitous across our sample, including a discourse of prevention.

To address this concern, a Special Interest Group (SIG) was convened at the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) Annual Meetings in May 2023 and May 2024. This SIG comprised members of the autistic community, senior clinical scientists, clinicians, advanced researchers, and early career researchers, who discussed and debated quality standards for autism intervention trials. This commentary summarizes relevant literature highlighted by SIG panelists and recommendations generated from small breakout groups and larger group discussions with SIG attendees. We recommend that all journals publishing autism intervention findings, especially autism‐focused journals, institute mandatory reporting practices (e.g., trial registration, protocol, analysis plan) to facilitate transparency and rigorous autism intervention science, as well as related education initiatives in support of this goal. Findings from the SIG offer practical, actionable recommendations that we advocate be systematically…"

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Adolescence is a time of complex social and emotional development when friendships become of particular importance. Previous research has highlighted differences in the social experience of autistic and non‐autistic adolescents, as well as that of autistic girls and boys. However, no study has compared the social experiences of autistic and non‐autistic adolescents, including gender differences, in a population‐representative sample. Using data from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), Sweep 6, we investigated differences between autistic (girls n = 111, boys n = 387) and non‐autistic (girls n = 5847, boys = 5697) adolescents (mean age = 13.7 years, range = 13–15) regarding self‐reports of: (i) having close friends, (ii) time spent with friends, (iii) social support, (iv) social alienation, (v) happiness with friendships, and (vi) having a romantic partner. Autistic adolescents reported having fewer close friends and spending less time with their friends. Autistic boys felt less socially supported than non‐autistic adolescents, while autistic girls felt more socially alienated than all other groups considered in the study. After accounting for hyperactivity and emotional pro…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Anxiety disorders are widespread and significantly impair the mental health and daily functioning of autistic children and adolescents. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a widespread, low-cost alternative to traditional CBT, helping to reduce demands on therapists without sacrificing efficacy. However, the predictors of treatment outcomes in iCBT for this population remain understudied. This study used data from a randomized clinical trial evaluating parent-led, therapist-supported iCBT among 57 autistic youth with anxiety disorders to examine whether repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, pretreatment anxiety severity, parent-rated externalizing symptoms, verbal intellectual ability, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity predicted treatment outcomes. Methods Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test the impact of these predictors on changes in evaluator-rated and parent-reported anxiety severity. Results Higher baseline anxiety severity was associated with greater improvement in evaluator- and parent-rated anxiety scores across the trial, while fewer externalizing behavior problems predicted more improvement in parent-report…",

We investigated whether autistic and TD adolescents might perform similarly on a categorical induction task when expressive language was controlled for, and whether autistic and TD children’s categorical induction abilities improved longitudinally. Methods Twenty-two TD and 20 autistic participants completed a ‘Diversity’ categorical induction task as adolescents. For the longitudinal analysis, we examined a subset (19 TD and 14 autistic participants) who had also completed an ‘Early’ categorical induction task as five-to-seven-year-olds. Results When expressive language was controlled for, groups did not statistically differ on categorical induction performance in adolescence. Expressive language also predicted performance above and beyond nonverbal IQ in both groups. In the longitudinal analysis, we observed that both groups’ categorical induction performance significantly improved over time, and the magnitude of improvement did not…",

The route to diagnosis can be long and circuitous, yet most evidence on adults’ experiences of diagnosis relies on retrospective reports collected at a single point in time. The current study explores lived experiences of the diagnostic journey through serial qualitative interviews conducted in the weeks before and after adults’ autism diagnosis. Fourteen adults participated in online interviews over videoconferencing or email. Thematic analysis of the data suggested the diagnostic process could be characterised according to three themes. Journey to Self-Discovery identified the pursuit of diagnosis as rooted in a drive for self-understanding, propelled by anticipated benefits that were partially realised, and emotionally complex at all stages. Challenges with Navigating the Diagnostic Process highlighted how the process of acquiring and adjusting to a diagnosis was shaped by issues of resource access, system deficiencies, social inequalities and cognitive overwhelm. Isolation to Advocacy revealed how journeys that…"

This study explored the experiences of Autistic women diagnosed after 30 in Australia.

Participants were recruited through purposive sampling on social media, and reflexive thematic analysis was used for data examination, with careful consideration of researcher reflexivity. Seven key emotionally centred themes were identified from the participants’ diagnostic journeys: (1) Frustration at the Barriers Surrounding a Diagnosis, (2) Fear and Self-Doubt on the Path to Self-Acceptance, (3) The Grief of Revisiting the Past, (4) Shock of the New Self, (5) Anger at Being Dismissed, (6) The Relief of Authenticity, and (7) Pride and Belonging in Community. The findings revealed the significant impact of ‘Autistic burnout’ and the challenges of accessing practitioners knowledgeable about Autism in women. Participants expressed a range of emotions stemming from having the validity of their struggles questioned an…"

      "abstract": "Social discounting describes the tendency to give fewer resources to those we feel less close to. Previous work suggests autistic individuals show a flatter decline in generosity towards socially distant others compared with non-autistic participants. We investigated whether this enhanced prosociality towards socially distant others in autism was driven by genuinely higher prosociality or instead a preference for repetitive responding. We measured prosocial preferences in 37 autistic and 38 non-autistic adults using the social value orientation questionnaire, where participants allocated money between themselves and people at six different social distances (e.g. friend vs stranger). We replicated previous findings by showing that autistic adults were more prosocial than non-autistic adults towards more socially distant others. Crucially, these effects were not driven by more repetitive responding in autism, nor by differences in attitudes to money. While autistic people often face challenges navigating their social worlds, our findings reinforce the view that autism is also associated with more prosociality. We argue that differences in fairness norms could drive more prosociality…",

      "abstract": "This study examined differences in referral and diagnosis based on sex recorded at birth (hereafter, ‘sex’), using case notes from 408 individuals diagnosed by 30 multidisciplinary teams across Scotland. Analyses focused on male-to-female ratios and median ages at referral and diagnosis across attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and intellectual disability. The lifespan male-to-female ratio across all diagnoses was 1.31, varying by category and age. In autism, the male-to-female ratio was 2.21 for children under 10 years, but there were more females in adolescence (male-to-female ratio = 0.79) and adulthood (male-to-female ratio = 0.94). Across the lifespan, combining all diagnoses, females were referred later (median ages: 14.4 vs 19.7 years; p &lt; 0.001) and diagnosed later (median ages: 15.2 vs 20.2 years; p &lt; 0.001), indicating a 5-year delay. Among autistic children and adolescents, females were referred later (median age: 7.5 vs 10.5 years; p = 0.002) and diagnosed later (median age: 9.3 vs 11.9 years; p = 0.003). However, no significant differences were found in age of referral or diagnosis for autistic adults. Overall, the results indicate increasing balanc…",

We studied the effects of additive treatment for sleep problems on self-reported symptoms of ADHD as primary outcome, with subscales of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, objective, performance-based ADHD symptoms, sleep quality, fatigue, and depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes. Methods: Preliminary open-label randomized controlled trial of adult patients diagnosed with ADHD and a positive screening for at least one sleep disorder. Participants were recruited between March, 2020 and May, 2023, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy patients (60% female, mean age 27.9 years [ SD = 8.2]) were randomized to a 12-week period of: (1) ADHD treatment as usual (TAU, n = 25), (2) ADHD TAU + sleep treatment ( n = 22), or (3) stand-alone sleep treatment ( n = 33). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. A total of 20% of participants did not complete the post-treatment assessment.

Decoding involves pattern recognition and sentence parsing, while linguistic comprehension requires understanding semantic context. Each component may differentially relate to social processing, carrying implications for reading among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often exhibit atypical social processing and communication. Methods We investigated relationships between social behavior patterns and literacy subskills among children aged 6–11 with ( n = 18) and without ( n = 27) ASD. We examined associations between behavioral attunement during a cooperative task between children and their parent, children’s scores on standardized reading assessments, and children’s autism symptoms. Behavioral attunement was coded through video recordings of child-parent interactions. Results Controlling for general intelligence, behavioral attunement was positively associated with reading comprehension and negatively associated with phonemic decoding and autism symptom severity in neurotypical and autistic children.

The current study explores how autistic participants perceive the potential of XR technologies to amplify their strengths, align with their priorities, and navigate barriers, guided by research questions focused on the adoption, relevance, and empowerment of XR tools for the transition-aged autistic population. Methods This study conducted focus group sessions with 12 autistic participants within the PHoENIX XR environment, using structured activities, virtual tours, and interactive tasks to gather data. Results Data were analyzed through a three-phase qualitative coding process, revealing two primary categories: Autistic-Centered Considerations and Technology-Centered Considerations. Overarching themes and subthemes were identified that provide nuanced insights into both the needs of transition-aged autistic individuals relative to XR and the affordances and limitations of XR platforms in supporting them.

While autistic burnout and camouflaging have been widely studied in general ASD populations, limited research has focused on Latino individuals, who may experience unique pressures due to cultural values such as collectivism, familism, and traditional gender roles. Participants ( N = 56) from the ¡Iniciando! la Adultez therapy program completed measures assessing burnout, camouflaging, acculturation, and cultural values. Results indicate that participants reported moderate to high levels of autistic burnout, with the highest levels observed in heightened self-awareness and cognitive disruption. Camouflaging behaviors were prevalent, with compensation being the most frequently used strategy. Cultural values, especially Mexican American values related to independence and familism, were positively correlated with burnout severity. In addition, camouflaging behaviors were significantly associated with higher adaptive functioning, particularly in conceptual, social, and practical domains, and were predictive of increased anx…",

While both autism and catatonia have been “detached” from schizophrenia, co-occurrence of the three conditions may be suspected in some cases, because of overlapping features, leading to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. This review provides an overview of the literature regarding the co-occurrence of autism, psychosis and catatonia. Methods A scoping review of peer-reviewed original research articles that simultaneously described all the three diagnostic constructs (autism, psychosis and catatonia) was performed. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, the review was based on MedLine, Scopus, PsycInfo and Cinahl databases. Studies included patients of all ages, races and both genders. A Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) of the contents of the articles was also performed. Results Seventeen articles ( n = 17) out of a total of 752 (after removing duplicates) met inclusion criteria, most of which (65%) were case reports/case series. Overall, majority of the studies lacked description of diagnostic procedures regarding psychosis - especially while describing co-occurrence of psychosis and catatonia…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Neuronal connectivity is refined throughout development by the proliferation and pruning of axons in cerebral white matter, and progressive axon myelination that enables rapid communication across brain regions. Differences in connectivity have been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including changes in white matter volume and connectivity. In the prefrontal cortex, this includes imbalances between short- and long-ranging axons, consistent with a pattern of local hyperconnectivity, and long-range hypoconnectivity. Alterations in temporal lobe white matter development—critical for social behavior—may contribute to atypical neural connectivity. Methods We used electron microscopy to analyze 54 samples of temporal lobe white matter from 27 age-matched postmortem brains from males with ASD and neurotypical (NT) controls, ages 2–44 years. Defined regions of superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter were sampled from superior temporal (STG) and fusiform (FG) gyri. Axon density and myelin thickness were quantified, with axon size classified by inner diameter, to evaluate age-related differences between ASD and neurotypical brains. Results In neurotypical…",

Design/methodology/approach The authors used narrative and inductive and theory-driven thematic approaches to analyse news articles. This study’s theory-driven data analysis phase was guided by Honneth’s recognition framework. Findings The analysis revealed dimensions of misrecognition in multiple spheres of life. These dimensions became visible, for example, as physical and social struggles, delayed or denied access to services and the desire to be openly autistic. The authors conclude that autistic women and girls are lacking recognition in society. Practical implications In spite of the increasing representations in the media, a larger understanding of the unique ways of being an autistic woman or a girl is needed. Practical implications for using the recognition framework as a tool for developing recognition will also be discussed. Originality/value Research on women’s and girls’ experiences of being autistic in news stories from the recognition perspective is scarce,…"

The aim of this research was to survey these linguistic behaviours from a self-report perspective and compare them to non-autistic multilingual individuals. Methods We collected data from 364 participants of which 177 (autistic = 98; mean age = 44.5, non-autistic = 79; mean age = 42.2) were included in the final analysis. Multilingual usage and switching behaviour were measured through an online questionnaire made available on Qualtrics, developed for the purpose of this research. Results The questionnaire revealed that autistic participants rated themselves as more multilingual, based on number of languages known, and used their respective languages more than non-autistic participants, although they reported switching between their languages as more effortful than non-autistic participants. A large portion of autistic individuals also reported using a non-native language daily and a similar number of autistic and non-autistic participants reported having lived in a country where their f…",

Despite increasing numbers of women entering reproductive years with this diagnosis, there is limited research on it in the perinatal period. Objective: To critically appraise the available literature and examine the association between maternal ADHD and depression in the perinatal period. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Google Scholar up to August 2024. The available literature was evaluated in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework, and a narrative synthesis was completed. Results: Ten studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority were of medium quality, with issues identified in sample size, study design and validity of the self-report scale used. Our review found a prevalence of 16.76% to 57.6% of perinatal depression in women with ADHD. An increased risk of developing p…"

However, research has yet to examine the IPV experiences of both dyad members where one or both partners has ADHD, and how those experiences differ from couples including partners without ADHD. Methods: 41 “ADHD couples” ( m age = 22.7 years), where one ( n = 33) or both ( n = 8) dyad members had ADHD, and 28 “Non-ADHD couples” ( m age = 23.4 years), where both dyad members did not have ADHD, participated. Both partners reported on the frequency they perpetrated and were victims of psychological and physical IPV. Results: Both partners in ADHD couples reported perpetrating more psychological and physical IPV than dyad members in Non-ADHD couples. Partners in ADHD couples also reported being victims of IPV more than partners in Non-ADHD couples. Conclusions: The risk of IPV perpetration in young adult couples with ADHD appears to be a two-way street. Research is needed to examine possible explanations for this pattern of reciprocal IPV, including mutual ADHD symptoms and related behavior (e.g., alcohol intox…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective The dearth of tools to quantify and track growth in social communication ability has been a barrier to understanding and monitoring treatment outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders. We undertook a multi-staged, multisite study to create the Developmental Assessment of Social Communication Ability (DASCA), a new measure explicitly developed as a clinical outcome assessment for monitoring change—both over the course of development and in response to treatment. Methods The DASCA is a caregiver-report instrument created using a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative components of this approach included focus groups and cognitive debriefing interviews. Quantitative components included dimensionality analysis, differential item functioning, and item response theory modeling. The item bank was iteratively refined to assess social communication skills that are typically acquired by early- to middle- childhood. Results The final DASCA item bank contains 184 items. Expressive language was a major factor in determining the appropriateness of some items for certain groups of children. Negligible differential item functioning, primarily by age, was observed for some items. Ho…"

      "abstract": "This study examines disparities in autism identification rates and support needs between Māori and non-Māori populations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The research was conducted through a collaborative approach with autistic Māori. Population-level administrative data were analysed for all individuals aged 0–24 years ( N = 1,565,505) as of 30 June 2018. Autism identification was determined through health service records from July 2010 to June 2018. Comparative analyses examined autism rates, intellectual disability (ID) co-occurrence, and Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS; high-need education funding support) allocation between Māori and non-Māori populations. Autism identification rates were lower among Māori (70.9/10,000) compared to non-Māori (78.3/10,000). Autistic Māori had higher rates of ID diagnosis (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.24) and ORS funding allocation (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.22, 1.48). The observed disparities in autism identification rates and diagnostic patterns suggest potential systemic barriers to autism identification among Māori, particularly for those with lower formal support needs. Future Kaupapa Māori, autistic-led research is warranted to better understand these d…"

In response, some post-secondary institutions have established Autism Support Programs (ASP) to address the comprehensive needs of this population. There is little up-to-date, comprehensive information about which institutions host these programs, what types of services they offer, and what is required to access them. Methods Expanding on previous research, we introduce a new method, which utilizes established data science techniques, to identify ASPs at post-secondary institutions in the U.S. Our technique also allows us to identify the characteristics of the ASPs, including admissions requirements, cost, structure, and supports offered. Results Results highlight our method is more efficient and more robust than previous methods from the literature. For example, we identify 49 schools hosting ASPs that were not identified in past literature searches. We report on the characteristics of identified ASPs such as application process, most common supports and program cost. Conclusion The bi-directional change in the number of ASPs shows that this is an evolving field, r…",

The tool aims to support early identification of children and young people (CYP) who may have a combination of unrecognised neurodevelopmental needs, special educational needs and disability (SEND), mental health needs or community support needs. It is intended to be used in a variety of non-specialist settings. The purpose of this study is to create a tool which identifies need across four key areas and signpost professionals to the relevant areas of support. Design/methodology/approach An audit of the adapted Thrive model for CYP (Wee et al., 2021) indicated a need for a stratification tool to support earlier recognition of intellectual needs. This led to a group of practitioners, including specialists in special educational needs and neurodevelopmental conditions working collaboratively to complete a Delphi process. This identified factors which would help identify need in 4 key areas of neurodiversity. Findings The Delphi process resulted in 26 factors being identified, which were considered using face and construct validity tool before being used to create the DNAT SEN tool. This tool can be use…"

This study aims to review the autism assessment process for children with a complex developmental condition, within a complex neurodisability autism assessment service, to help identify learning points from clinical practice that may be beneficial to other practitioners. Design/methodology/approach A clinical audit reviewing team databases and autism assessment records were undertaken to identify the profile of children accessing the neurodisability service and how the ADOS-2 assessment was adapted to meet the needs of this population. Findings The ADOS-2 required adaptations in terms of administration (e.g. how activities are delivered), and consideration needed to be given to how behaviours were coded using the ADOS-2 algorithm (to help consider how features of neurodisability may be captured on the algorithm). Practical implications This study outlines how clinicians can use the ADOS-2 assessment tool for children with complex neurodisabilities. The find…"

ARFID is characterised by three primary features, namely, sensory-based avoidance of food, negative food experiences or not experiencing hunger feelings. ARFID is particularly prevalent among autistic children and adolescents, significantly impacting their psychological, physical and social health needs. However, challenges remain in the early recognition of ARFID and the availability of effective interventions. This study aims to examine the key signs and symptoms to support early identification of ARFID in autistic children and young people, alongside an exploration of evidence-based interventions. Design/methodology/approach A scoping reviewed was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Scoping Review Methodology to examine and understand the current signs and symptoms of ARFID, as well as existing interventions.

However, research would indicate that the mealtime and eating challenges also have far-reaching consequences for the parents and family of the autistic child. Evidence from past systematic reviews shows that behaviourist-based interventions are the most effective for increasing oral intake. This scoping review aims to systematically search the literature to landscape interventions with other theoretical underpinnings for autistic children under 12 years of age, and to explore if consideration is given to the impact of these eating challenges on the parents and families. A search was conducted in line with PRISMA-ScR checklist across five databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Embase) to identify studies that were published in the last 50 years (from 1973 to 2023). Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were grouped into three categories: psychology-led, occupational therapy-led, multi-disciplinary-led (home and school).

These young people can become especially vulnerable if their sexual behaviour is inappropriate. Methods The current studies explored the effectiveness of culturally attuned Behavioural Activation to enhance safeguarding five autistic young people, while at the same time, not abrogating safe and appropriate sexual behaviour. The intervention was delivered via telehealth services. Results A significant decrease and eventually cessation of public masturbation (in four participants) and undressing others without their consent (in one participant) was observed. Conclusion Findings are discussed in terms of adaptations to the intervention to suit the Arab culture, individual family preferences, as well as implication for SHE and the use of Behavioural Activation more generally."

The prevalence of ASD has increased in the last decades, and research has widened its study to the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP). Therefore, it is important to develop effective screening tools to detect ASD and BAP in the general population. The Autism Spectrum Quotient, Children´s version (AQ-Child) is a 50-item parent-report questionnaire developed to assess autistic traits in children aged 4–11 years. The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the AQ-Child to Spanish as part of a school-based screening program in Salamanca, Castile and León, Spain. Methods The AQ-Child was translated, pilot-tested, and administered online through the Qualtrics platform of the University of Salamanca to a school population sample ( n = 602). Results A total of 45 cases scored at or above the established cut-off point of 76 points on the Spanish version of the AQ-Child (AQ-Child-SV) and 18 scored between 70 and 75 points.

We evaluated a shortened version of the 65-item Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Methods A total of 1,462 dyads from the Simons Simplex Collection consisted of a child with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a sibling without ASD. All siblings were free of suspected intellectual disabilities and severe learning disabilities, had neither developmental nor psychiatric disorders, and did not have an Individual Education Plan for extensive special education services. Areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curves quantified scale performance. A non-inferiority margin of − 0.005 was pre-specified. Results The AUROC for the 5-item scale (5iSRS) was 0.9943, the predictive value positive was 97.3% and predictive value negative was 96.9%. The AUROC for the 65-item SRS was 0.9926, resulting in an AUROC difference of 0.0017 (95% CI=[– 0.0003, 0.0037]) and meeting the non-inferiority criterion.

However, little is known about how pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period influence ADHD related problems, help-seeking behaviors or the timing of ADHD diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate incident ADHD diagnoses among women from 5 years before to 5 years after childbirth. Method: The population-based cohort study utilized Danish nationwide registers to identify mothers of all childbirths between 2010 and 2018. ADHD diagnoses, defined as ICD-10 codes (F90 or F98.8) or redemption of ADHD medication prescriptions, were recorded during 1994 to 2023. Women who received an ADHD diagnosis prior to the five-year pre-birth period were excluded. We estimated calendar-year adjusted incidence of first-time maternal ADHD diagnoses using Poisson regression, and compared incidence across pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum up to 2 years, and 2 to 5 years postpartum, reporting adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Analyses included psychiatric comorbidities and non-ADHD psychotropic medication use prior to an ADHD diagnosis, for women diagnosed with ADHD postpartum. Results: The s…"

This study clinically evaluated the effect of progesterone use during pregnancy on the risk of ADHD in children. Methods: In this prospective case-control study, 97 children diagnosed with ADHD and 194 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Maternal progesterone use—via suppositories or injections—during pregnancy was assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Results: The mean age was slightly higher in the ADHD group, but not significantly. Male predominance was observed among ADHD cases, although not statistically significant. While neonatal hospitalization rates were similar, the duration was longer in the ADHD group ( p = .009). Cesarean delivery and lower maternal education levels were significantly more common in the ADHD group ( p = .004 and p = .013, respectively). No significant difference in overall progesterone use was found between ADHD and control groups (17.5% vs. 19.1%; p = .749).

      "abstract": "Abstract Methods A total of 82 Chinese-speaking children with autism aged 4–9 years were assigned to an HBI or an RBI group through stratified randomization. Before the intervention, the children’s autism severity, verbal comprehension, and Theory of Mind skills were assessed. Each child received four 30-min training sessions over 4 weeks, during which they watched four dramas performed by human or robot actors, in which one character shared an event with another character, who then displayed an empathic response. Parents completed a questionnaire before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention, and children’s cognitive empathy (CE), affective empathy (AE), and prosocial behavior (PB) were evaluated in an experimental task. Results Both RBI and HBI training promote empathy skills, specifically CE, AE, and PB, as evaluated through children’s verbal responses in story tasks. Conclusion RBI empathy training demonstrates comparable reliability and effectiveness to human teaching, suggesting that RBIs can assist human therapists in promoting empathy in children with autism.

Depression is highly heterogeneous and may present differently in populations with ADHD. This study aimed to explore different symptom presentations of depression and associated clinical correlates in a clinical ADHD sample. Method: We analysed data from the Study of ADHD Genes and Environment (SAGE). Parents completed semi-structured interviews about their child’s psychopathology at baseline ( M age = 10.9 years) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire to capture their child’s depression symptoms approximately 5 years later ( M age = 14.6 years, N = 246). Depression symptom presentations were derived by latent profile analysis. Results: Analyses found three presentations of depression symptoms: a ‘low symptoms’ class (48.5% of the sample), a ‘high symptoms’ class (15.5%) with consistently high depression symptoms, particularly for suicidality and poor self-esteem items, and an ‘irritable/poor sleep’ class (36.1%) with high scores for irritability and poor sleep and intermediate levels of other depression symptoms.

CPRT provides teaching strategies that addresses student motivation, initiation, and generalization during implementation of learning goals. All students in the study had diagnoses of moderate to severe autism, and some also had intellectual disability. Methods We assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and implementation fidelity of CPRT using a mixed-methods approach. Eight special educators were trained in CPRT over ten weeks. Results All eight educators were successfully trained to fidelity, and six of eight teachers maintained fidelity 1.5 to 4 months after training.

Given shortages, access to professionals with expertise in AAC instruction can prove difficult. Telepractice may help to connect more specialists to children and practitioners or families who can implement AAC interventions with guidance. As both AAC technology and telehealth rapidly advance, the evidence-base has struggled to keep pace. This systematic review answers questions related to the use of telepractice in intervention for AAC. Data to be reported were gleaned from a comprehensive meta-analysis on AAC and intervention for preschool and school-age children on the autism spectrum and/or with IDD. In the current systematic review, eight studies were identified, representing 22 participants, that met inclusion criteria. Synthesized findings across telepractice methodologies, participant characteristics, intervention parameters, including intervention intensity, and methodological quality are reported.",

Thus, it is crucial to identify factors associated with these two unfavourable dietary behaviours in autistic children. This cross-sectional study examined the associations between screen time and sleep quality with diet quality and food selectivity among autistic children, and the extent to which screen time was indirectly associated with diet quality and food selectivity through sleep quality. Method The parents of 628 autistic children aged 7–12 years in Australia reported on their child’s screen time, sleep quality, diet quality and food selectivity via an online questionnaire. Results Structural equation modelling of the hypothesised mediation model revealed significant associations between screen time and sleep disturbances (β = 0.118, 95%CI = 0.032, 0.204, p = .007), and between sleep disturbances with lower diet quality (β = -0.077, 95%CI = -0.153, -0.001, p = .047) and higher food selectivity (β = 0.198, 95%CI = 0.119, p &lt; .00…",

The high prevalence of suicidality has been associated with lack of support and interventions to meet the specific needs of autistic people. This scoping review aimed to better understand the quantity and nature of existing primary research evaluating interventions to support autistic people experiencing suicidality, to inform the commissioning of future primary research. Twenty-seven studies were included: 18 focused on evaluating or developing interventions to reduce suicidality, and nine on evaluating/developing screening procedures to identify autistic people potentially at risk of dying by suicide. Findings suggest researchers are adapting and testing interventions to reduce suicidality in partnership with autistic people, but there is still work needed to enable autistic people to communicate suicidal thoughts and behaviours and develop clinician knowledge and understanding.

Mood disturbances, environmental vulnerabilities, and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are risk factors for not flourishing. There is limited research on protective relational factors, as measured by Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs), as facilitators of flourishing in children with ADHD and comorbid mood disturbances. Method: Using a nationally representative sample of 4,847 children, aged 6 to 17 years-old, currently diagnosed with ADHD, hierarchical binary logistic regression examined whether the number of PCEs present for children with and without mood disturbances could significantly predict who was flourishing or not. The initial model included demographics, ADHD treatment-related variables, and the number of ACEs encountered. Results: After controlling for covariates, the odds of flourishing measured by the Child Flourishing Index (CFI) for children with ADHD were 7.31 [4.51, 11.86] times greater for those with 6 to 7 PCEs compared to peers with 0 to 2 PCEs, and 3.37 [2.24, 5…"

Both groups of individuals have reported difficulties when accessing inpatient services including stigma, lack of understanding and lack of adaptations.

These conditions often co-occur, making it difficult to determine the specific contribution of each to the overall pattern of observed motor challenges across neurodivergence. The COMBINE dataset included 262 cases (216 Male, 46 Female) with one or more neurodevelopmental conditions. We used generalized linear models to assess the effect of each of 4 diagnoses (autism, ADHD, DCD, CAS) on Movement Assessment Battery for Children (2nd edition, MABC-2) total score, Manual Dexterity domain score, Aiming &amp; Catching domain score, and Balance domain score; age; sex, and diagnoses. Movement scores were low in all groups, with 77% of cases in the Red Zone (DCD likely). Diagnosis of DCD predicted lower overall scores and Manual Dexterity scores, diagnosis of ADHD predicted higher overall scores and Balance scores, and diagnosis of autism predicted lower Aiming &amp; Catching scores. These results suggest motor challenges are clinically-significant across several neurodevelopmental conditions, and that some cond…"

Thirty-nine studies were analyzed to determine who received instruction, what topics were covered, and how programs were delivered. Findings revealed an emphasis on healthy relationships and consent, but infrequent coverage of contraception, sexual diversity, and decision-making. Instructional content varied widely and often lacked alignment with national sex education standards. Many studies omitted implementation details critical for replication. Implications for practice include the need to evaluate existing programs using national frameworks and to foster collaboration between educators and healthcare professionals to support accessible, inclusive sexuality education."

Sixty-one adolescents aged 12–17 with ADHD met the inclusion criteria (M age = 14.46 ± 1.51 years). MVPA levels were assessed with accelerometers worn around their waist for seven consecutive days. Physical self-concept and psychological ill-being (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress) were examined using questionnaires. Pearson correlations among those variables were examined. Mediation analyses were performed with adjustments for confounders. Moderator analyses were also conducted. Physical self-concept partially mediated the association between MVPA and depression, explaining 23% of the variance. Meanwhile, physical self-concept partially mediated the association of MVPA with stress and the indirect effect accounted for 20% of the variance, mainly driven by the appearance dimension.

While previous work has highlighted factors specific to individuals and/or job sectors that serve as barriers or facilitators to autistic employment, the question of how to modify the workplace to best support autistic people remains under-researched. The present study utilized an ecological framework to investigate what workplace factors can be modified to improve autistic experiences and how these modifications may be enacted across different levels of workplace ecosystem to promote autistic success. Autistic participants ( N = 85) across employment sectors provided quantitative ratings and written descriptions of positive and negative factors related to their workplace experiences. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to examine which factors and overarching principles most impact employment. Actionable strategies to modify these factors were derived from participant responses and validated by autistic collaborators and neuroinclusion experts. On average, participants rated task training as having the most positive, and mental health a…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Autistic girls have been underrepresented in research, which has traditionally focused on male-dominated samples. As a result, there is limited understanding of the unique mental health difficulties they experience and the challenges they encounter when accessing appropriate services. Adolescence is a significant developmental stage where girls can be more vulnerable due to biological, social, and psychological changes. This transitional period may be when girls present for an autism assessment or begin to experience significant mental health difficulties. Methods This qualitative study explored the mental health difficulties of six autistic adolescent girls attending Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Ireland. Results Following an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), three Group Experiential Themes (GETs) were identified: (1) Understanding the Relationship between Autism and Mental Health in Autistic Adolescent Girls, (2) Navigating Social Environments as an Autistic Adolescent Girl with Mental Health Difficulties, and (3) Disconnect between the Needs of Autistic Girls and their Support. Conclusions These results provide valuable ins…"

      "abstract": "Background: College students often engage in heavy alcohol use and experience poor sleep. These risks are exacerbated among students with ADHD, who are especially vulnerable to both poor sleep and alcohol-related negative consequences. Although prior research has often focused on average sleep patterns, the impact of variability in sleep (i.e., bedtime, duration, and waketime) remains understudied. This variability may be particularly important for individuals with ADHD, given the self-regulation challenges that underline both sleep and alcohol use. Therefore, we examined ADHD-related differences in sleep variability and tested whether sleep variability predicts alcohol-related negative consequences. Methods: Utilizing 2-week daily diaries in a sample engaging in heavy drinking ( N = 101; ADHD = 51, without ADHD = 50), Dynamic Structural Equation Models (DSEM) were applied to examine ADHD group differences in sleep variability and sleep averages (bedtime, waketime, and duration) and alcohol-related negative consequences, and test if sleep variability predicted negative consequences. Results: ADHD group status was significantly associated with later average waketimes, but not in ave…"

Method: Using data from an online survey distributed at six US colleges/universities, participants ( N = 4,897; 74% female; 60% White) reported on current ADHD symptomatology and diagnostic status; personal, social, and familial resilience; and physical, psychological, social, environmental, and global QoL. Results: Compared to students who were undiagnosed and asymptomatic or diagnosed and asymptomatic , participants who were symptomatic (diagnosed and undiagnosed) evidenced lower resilience and QoL across all domains. There were significant interactions between ADHD group and resilience for global QoL and environmental QoL. Global QoL among undiagnosed and symptomatic participants was consistently lower than the refere…"

Few have examined caregiver perceptions of direct-to-home telehealth evaluations for children with developmental concerns broader than ASD. The current study explored caregiver perspectives ( N = 439) of the telehealth process, including technology barriers and satisfaction with remote delivery of diagnostic feedback, before and after a 24-month tele-assessment, in children from four outcome groups (ASD, Speech-Language Concerns, Other Developmental Concerns, and No Concerns). The results indicated overall high levels of caregiver satisfaction and acceptability across all outcome groups, although the ASD group had a lower rate (89%) than the other groups (99–100%) of rating “very true” to feeling like a valued partner in the tele-assessment, the evaluation meeting their needs (89% v. 94–99%), and understanding the results (86% v. 96–98%). Families of children with Speech-Language Concerns, the largest diagnostic outcome group, were highly satisfied and found tele-assessment acceptable.

Here we report an experiment that investigated anticipation of narrative events in autistic adults, who have previously been shown to have atypical narrative cognition. Using the visual world paradigm, N = 25 autistic and N = 25 neurotypical adults (matched on age, sex, and IQ) listened to non-social and social narratives in which a simple or complex context elicited anticipation of a subsequent outcome. For each narrative event, eye movements were tracked to four pictures, including two that depicted potential context-relevant outcomes. For non-social narratives, autistic (relative to neurotypical) adults were delayed in anticipating simple (i.e., factual), but faster in anticipating complex (i.e., counterfactual), narrative events. For social narratives, autistic adults were faster to anticipate simple narrative events (requiring basic mentalizing of a character’s desires and intentions), and neither group successfully anticipated complex narrative events.

This review is of peer-support programs for individuals with autism, focusing on impact, facilitators, and barriers. A systematic literature review was conducted using Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts.

Fifteen articles described 12 unique peer-support programs with varying goals, such as enhancing personal development. Studies reported diverse improvements, including enhanced well-being, self-esteem, and academic performance. Many participants valued connecting with peers in an autism-focused context.

      "abstract": "Abstract The implementation of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems for individuals with nonverbal Autism Spectrum Disorder (nvASD) remains highly debated, especially in a multilingual and multicultural country like India. Existing AAC guidelines are largely Western-based and may not be fully applicable in the Indian context. This study explored the perspectives of Indian Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) on AAC implementation in individuals with nvASD. A cross-sectional study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved developing and validating a questionnaire assessing SLP’s practices and attitudes towards AAC. In phase 2, the validated questionnaire was administered online to 93 Indian SLPs (29.23 years of mean age, 71% female) represented diverse clinical, educational, and academic settings. The survey explored key parameters, including AAC candidacy, cultural and linguistic adaptation, AAC selection and customization, interdisciplinary collaboration and caregiver involvement, outcome based evaluation practices, speech-AAC integration, and barriers to AAC implementation. Most SLPs emphasized working on communication prerequisites before introducing AAC.…",

Data were collected using measures of ToM, autistic traits, social skills, problem behaviors, and friendship quality. Independent samples t -tests and Pearson correlations were used to characterize group differences and variable relationships. Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the roles of social skills and problem behaviors in the relationship between ToM and friendship quality across groups. Individuals with ASD reported lower friendship quality, with less companionship, help, security, and closeness, experienced more conflicts in friendships than their non-autistic peers, and exhibited lower ToM performance. Multi-group SEM indicated significant positive effects of ToM on social skills in both groups, with a stronger effect observed in ASD. Additionally, th…",

This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Social Responsiveness Scale 2nd Edition (SRS-2) -answered by parents- in a Spanish population and to develop a shortened form of the scale for autism screening. A total of 528 children and adolescents with autistic diagnosis, ADHD, and non-diagnosis participated in the study. Factorial analysis indicated a unidimensional structure with excellent reliability (Cronbach’s α = .96) and a KMO index of .95. A moderate sensitivity (69.4%) and high specificity (88.5%) were found for a score of ≥ 60. The 10 items with the highest factor loading have constituted a reliable SRS-2 short form ( α = .92), valid for identifying autism. This shortened version showed an area under the ROC curve of 86.3%, with high sensitivity (83.8%) and moderate specificity (75.3%) for a score of ≥ 5. This short form has shown to be an effective screening tool in the Spanish population, retaining psychometric properties comparable to the original scale. The findings conclude that both versions are reliable and valid, and we support the ut…"

Through synthesizing findings from five single-case experimental design studies, the analysis explores how different modalities, age groups, instructional contexts, and task types influence comprehension outcomes. Results indicate that interventions utilizing PGR show moderate-to-strong positive effects overall (Tau-U = 0.85), which means they significantly improve reading comprehension in students with ASD. However, variability was observed across modalities, with technology-based interventions demonstrating strong but varied effectiveness, and paper-based interventions exhibiting more consistent outcomes.The findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting appropriate visual supports and comprehension measures tailored to students’ cognitive profiles and instructional needs. Future research should expand sample sizes, explore group instructional settings, and further investigate the relative effectiveness of various visual modalities to optimize educational strategies for enhancing…",

Participants were inpatient clients of the neuropsychology service of a private adult, mental health treatment service. A structured, qualitative, interview framework and thematic analysis was employed, with questions focused on clients’ experience of the assessment process, recommendations for improvements and utility of the feedback provided. Ten adult clients with Autism participated (83% participation rate). All participants described having a positive experience with the assessment, from the information pre-assessment, to the assessment tasks, and the clinicians’ approach.

Socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors present barriers to treatment access and lead to disparate outcomes in children with ADHD. The purpose of this study was to describe trajectories of functional outcomes and ADHD symptom counts across 3 years and explore the moderating effects of income and race/ethnicity on these trajectories among U.S. children with ADHD. Method: This longitudinal study of children currently and/or previously meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD ( N = 1,587, age = 9–10 years at baseline) used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study ® . Outcomes were child-reported functional outcome measures (family conflict, prosocial behavior, and school experiences) and parent-reported inattentive and hyperactive symptom counts across 3 years. Multi-level, mixed-effects models for longitudinal data were used to characterize each outcome trajectory and examine the moderating effects of baseline household income and race/ethnicity. Results: The sample was 68% male and 54% White, with 53% meeting diagnostic criteria for past-only ADHD, 12% current-only ADHD, and 35% both past and current ADHD. Si…"

It aimed to provide a deeper qualitative understanding by incorporating the perspectives of autistic adolescents and their family members, adding depth to existing quantitative findings. This qualitative study involved audio-recorded semi-structured in-depth interviews with 40 participants, including mothers, fathers, siblings, and autistic adolescents, recruited through autism and disability agencies in Canberra, Australia. Data collection and analysis followed a constructivist grounded theory approach. Reflexive journaling and iterative member checking ensured the accuracy and validity of the findings. The study found that autism significantly influenced family dynamics, leading to behaviors such as self-harm, anxiety, overstimulation, anger, and limited social and emotional awareness, which strained family relationships. Families reported increased stress and tension, particularly in the absence of regular support and respite. Despite these challenges, families employed various strategies to maintain close relationships and foster resilience, such as sharing memories…"

      "abstract": "Abstract The current study aims to report on the concordance between the PHQ-9, GAD-7, Adult Self Report (ASR), Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5), and best estimate clinical diagnosis (BECD) among autistic adults. The current analyses leverage baseline data from a feasibility treatment study of autistic adults receiving group behavioral activation therapy to address anxiety and depressive symptoms. Interclass correlation coefficients, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were computed to compare the tools to one another at various clinical cut-off levels. Post-intervention outcome data were used for internal replication. The ADIS-5 classifications of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) had strong concordance in comparison to the BECD in the Baseline comparisons, but more variable in the Outcome data. For the GAD-7, the mild cut-off had the highest concordance with BECD of any anxiety condition. PHQ-9 moderate cut-off performed most consistently with BECD and ADIS-5 MDD diagnosis. The present analyses further highlight the need for ongoing systematic investigation of the validity of anxiety and depres…",

      "abstract": "Objective Children and adolescents frequently struggle with social skills performance in academic settings, which can negatively impact quality of life. As such, social skills training is frequently recommended; however, the effectiveness of school-based social skills training has not been synthesized. As such, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the empirical evidence pertaining to both stand-alone and multimodal school-based social skills programs for students with ADHD, and to assess the effects of potential moderating variables. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies between the years of 1975 and 2023 following the recommendations of the Cochrane Foundation and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Results: Seventeen studies, single-case, within group, and between-group designs met the established inclusion criteria, with 10 included in the meta-analysis. The findings revealed small to large effects; however, the overall meta-analytic effect size was negligible (ES = 0.09). The differences in social skills approaches, intensity, parent involvement, and setting did not moderate the effects. C…"
