      "abstract": "Early intervention (EI) can improve developmental outcomes among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but underdiagnosis and undertreatment are common among low-income families and children of racial/ethnic minorities. The Screening and Linkage to Services for Autism (SaLSA) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02374541) demonstrated that autism family navigation (AFN) improved the likelihood that young children at risk for ASD completed a diagnostic evaluation. In a qualitative descriptive U.S. study, we recruited parent participants, health care and EI providers and staff, and project personnel from the SaLSA trial to participate in semi-structured interviews on acceptability and feasibility of AFN services for families seen in urban safety-net clinical settings (i.e., where care is provided regardless of ability to pay). Iterative theme analysis was performed. A community focus group was conducted for triangulation to improve validity. Results demonstrated four main themes: (1) “It’s all in a name: the risk of engagement”; (2) “Community partnerships require authentic trust”; (3) “System interactions and interrelationships”; and (4) “What is an autism family navigat…",

      "abstract": "Data-based decision-making (DBDM) is crucial for teachers of students with autism or intellectual disability, yet little is known about their engagement in DBDM. We surveyed 77 teachers in the southeastern United States who had worked with students with autism or intellectual disability in self-contained classrooms in the past year. They reported their training and practices in DBDM and the variables they perceived to facilitate and inhibit data collection, graphing, and data-based decision-making. Teachers reported minimal training in DBDM. While some frequently collect data, methods and frequency of data interpretation for instructional decisions vary. Teachers identified time as the biggest barrier to DBDM. Despite recognizing its importance, teachers lack tools to meet accountability standards, highlighting the need for preservice training and ongoing support. Research is warranted on efficient and effective methods for training teachers of students with autism or intellectual disability to engage in DBDM in their classrooms.",

The CCT was an intervention program designed to train and coach early intervention service providers (EISPs) so that they can coach parents to use evidence-based naturalistic communication teaching strategies (i.e., modeling, mand-model, and time delay) and reading techniques during shared book reading with their young children with autism. Three participating U.S. service providers went through a self-directed training via online modules and were coached via telepractice technologies (videoconferences). Using a single-case multiple-baseline design across participants, we (a) examined EISPs’ implementation fidelity (accuracy/quality) of coaching practices, (b) assessed their knowledge on communication strategies and coaching practices, and (c) sought information about their perception on the feasibility and outcomes of the intervention. Visual analysis of the observational data showed a functional relation between the CCT program and EISPs’ coaching practices.",

      "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating regarding an association between autism and functional neurological disorder, a common cause for a wide range of neurological symptoms affecting motor, sensory and cognitive systems. Symptoms can include paralysis, tremors, sensory disturbance, vision loss and dizziness. Functional neurological disorder exists at the complex intersection of physical and mental health, neurology and psychiatry, and body and mind. Despite a recent resurgence in clinical and scientific interest, functional neurological disorder has lagged behind other causes of neurological symptoms in research, service development and acceptance. The nature of the association between autism and functional neurological disorder remains uncertain, but several plausible mechanisms can be identified from overlapping areas of research, highlighting endogenous factors such as atypical interoception, motor function, emotional processing and sensorimotor integration, alongside exogenous influences including adversity, healthcare inequality and stigma. This review first provides an overview of functional neurological disorder through various explanatory frameworks before applying biopsychosocial, neur…"

      "abstract": "Linguistic alignment reflects shared linguistic behaviors (e.g. syntax and lexicon) between interlocutors. Recent work has examined whether autistic children align to the same degree as their non-autistic peers, with current findings inconclusive. This study took an in-depth approach to investigating factors contributing to variation in linguistic alignment among autistic individuals. Eighteen school-age and adolescent autistic male participants, 14 males with fragile X syndrome + autism, and their mothers participated in the study. Dyads engaged in an unstructured conversation for ~12 min. Using Bayesian linear mixed-effect models, we assessed the relationships between alignment and within-individual factors of the participants. Lexical and syntactic alignment were uniquely influenced by within-participant factors. Maternal lexical and syntactic alignment were differentially associated with participant cognitive and expressive language abilities, and according to etiology (fragile X syndrome + autism vs idiopathic autism). This study highlights the complexity of alignment in autistic individuals and their mothers. Results suggest that alignment is a dynamic process that is motivat…",

We examined basic psychometric properties of the PROMIS caregiver-proxy scales and tested the scales for measurement invariance between groups of autistic children who are minimally verbal with intellectual disability and those without signficant intellectuatl disability ( N = 448). We also descriptively examined feedback from caregivers regarding the appropriateness of the questions to capture meaningful outcomes for their autistic children who are minimally verbal with intellectual disability.

      "abstract": "Ableist microaggressions—subtle forms of disability-based discrimination—constitute a key minority stressor. Amplified by autistic identity contingencies that shape how autistic identity is judged and treated in social contexts, these factors drive social camouflage in autistic adults, compelling them to conceal autistic characteristics for adapting to non-autistic groups, often resulting in negative mental health outcomes. This study proposes a novel autistic identity contingencies model to explore how autism acceptance and loneliness mediate the relationship between ableist microaggressions and social camouflage. An online survey of 330 autistic adults was conducted, followed by hierarchical multiple regression and chain mediation analyses. Results revealed that, ableist microaggressions positively predicted three social camouflage phenotypes: compensation, masking, and assimilation, with loneliness also positively predicting assimilation. Furthermore, after controlling for personal attributes, general stress and mental health conditions, lower external autism acceptance and higher loneliness mediated the positive relationship between ableist microaggressions and assimilation, wh…",

However, no study has yet examined the extent to which transgender and gender-diverse identity predicts specific co-occurring mental health diagnoses in autistic adolescents. In a sample of 9027 autistic adolescents aged 13 to 17 drawn from the Simons Powering Autism Research for Knowledge cohort, 36 of whom we identified as transgender and gender diverse, we estimated univariate models of transgender and gender-diverse identity as a predictor of individual diagnoses.

White autistic men, but not Black autistic men, were evaluated less favorably than non-male autistic participants, with Black autistic men being evaluated more favorably on some items.

Yet, most educators are not trained in neurodevelopmental disabilities, leaving them with outdated knowledge and limited confidence about how to support neurodivergent youth at school. In a two-phase project, we sought to (1) co-design a comprehensive professional development training for school educators and (2) pilot test this training in one US public school district. First, we used community-based participatory research methods to form an interdisciplinary team of neurodivergent educators and autistic community members. We then used human-centered design methods to iteratively design the Schools Unified in Neurodiversity professional development training for US K-12 educators.

      "abstract": "Autistic advocates have raised substantial concerns regarding genetics research on autism. It is yet unclear whether these concerns reflect the perspectives of the broader autism community. In a sample of 1757 Dutch autistic adults, 445 parents of autistic children and 126 legal representatives of autistic adults, we explored perspectives on genetics research. We used a pilot repeated survey, consisting of questions about the perceived importance of the heritability of autism, reasons for this importance and the desire to learn more about heritability. Over 95% of the participants found it at least a little important to know that autism is highly heritable, and 67% would like to learn more about it. Participants mentioned that they find it important to increase knowledge about the causes of autism, and to improve the diagnostic process. There were no substantial differences in perspectives between stakeholder groups. Contrasting previous work, this pilot study indicates support for genetics research in autism, which highlights diversity in community perspectives. It also identifies an unmet educational need. We conclude that education on the topic of genetics, active research invol…",

This cross-sectional study examined the role of social drivers of health in the communication abilities of autistic individuals ages 13–30. Participants ( N = 73) completed language, nonverbal cognitive assessments, and social drivers of health (sense of community, unmet services, barriers to services) measures. Data were analyzed descriptively and using mixed-effects modeling. More unmet service needs, more barriers to services, and a lower sense of community were associated with greater social communication impairment. In turn, both unmet service needs and barriers to services were negatively associated with functional communication.

This study aims to investigate the association between applied behavior analysis therapy and post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidality, mental health hospitalization rates, and length of mental health hospitalizations using a national database of privately insured youth under 18. We matched 17,120 autistic youth who received applied behavior analysis with a control group of autistic youth with no record of applied behavior analysis and clustered them into four applied behavior analysis dose groups using two-stage bisecting k-medians clustering. Then, we used negative binomial regression and logistic regression to compare outcomes for the applied behavior analysis and non-applied behavior analysis groups. Overall, applied behavior analysis receipt was associated with 30% higher odds of experiencing a mental health hospitalization (odds ratio = 1.30, p &lt; 0.001) and a 32% higher incidence rate of these hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio = 1.32, p &lt; 0.001).

The route to diagnosis can be long and circuitous, yet most evidence on adults’ experiences of diagnosis relies on retrospective reports collected at a single point in time. The current study explores lived experiences of the diagnostic journey through serial qualitative interviews conducted in the weeks before and after adults’ autism diagnosis. Fourteen adults participated in online interviews over videoconferencing or email. Thematic analysis of the data suggested the diagnostic process could be characterised according to three themes. Journey to Self-Discovery identified the pursuit of diagnosis as rooted in a drive for self-understanding, propelled by anticipated benefits that were partially realised, and emotionally complex at all stages. Challenges with Navigating the Diagnostic Process highlighted how the process of acquiring and adjusting to a diagnosis was shaped by issues of resource access, system deficiencies, social inequalities and cognitive overwhelm. Isolation to Advocacy revealed how journeys that…"

      "abstract": "Social discounting describes the tendency to give fewer resources to those we feel less close to. Previous work suggests autistic individuals show a flatter decline in generosity towards socially distant others compared with non-autistic participants. We investigated whether this enhanced prosociality towards socially distant others in autism was driven by genuinely higher prosociality or instead a preference for repetitive responding. We measured prosocial preferences in 37 autistic and 38 non-autistic adults using the social value orientation questionnaire, where participants allocated money between themselves and people at six different social distances (e.g. friend vs stranger). We replicated previous findings by showing that autistic adults were more prosocial than non-autistic adults towards more socially distant others. Crucially, these effects were not driven by more repetitive responding in autism, nor by differences in attitudes to money. While autistic people often face challenges navigating their social worlds, our findings reinforce the view that autism is also associated with more prosociality. We argue that differences in fairness norms could drive more prosociality…",

The lifespan male-to-female ratio across all diagnoses was 1.31, varying by category and age. In autism, the male-to-female ratio was 2.21 for children under 10 years, but there were more females in adolescence (male-to-female ratio = 0.79) and adulthood (male-to-female ratio = 0.94). Across the lifespan, combining all diagnoses, females were referred later (median ages: 14.4 vs 19.7 years; p &lt; 0.001) and diagnosed later (median ages: 15.2 vs 20.2 years; p &lt; 0.001), indicating a 5-year delay.

Participants ( N = 56) from the ¡Iniciando! la Adultez therapy program completed measures assessing burnout, camouflaging, acculturation, and cultural values. Results indicate that participants reported moderate to high levels of autistic burnout, with the highest levels observed in heightened self-awareness and cognitive disruption. Camouflaging behaviors were prevalent, with compensation being the most frequently used strategy. Cultural values, especially Mexican American values related to independence and familism, were positively correlated with burnout severity. In addition, camouflaging behaviors were significantly associated with higher adaptive functioning, particularly in conceptual, social, and practical domains, and were predictive of increased anx…",

Autism identification was determined through health service records from July 2010 to June 2018. Comparative analyses examined autism rates, intellectual disability (ID) co-occurrence, and Ongoing Resourcing Scheme (ORS; high-need education funding support) allocation between Māori and non-Māori populations. Autism identification rates were lower among Māori (70.9/10,000) compared to non-Māori (78.3/10,000).

These two types of MW are also differentially associated with affective well-being. Most existing studies in ADHD, however, mainly rely on retrospective reports of MW tendencies, which are susceptible to memory-related errors and biases. Further, most studies categorise participants based on overall levels of ADHD, instead of accounting for the spectrum and dimensional heterogeneity of ADHD, including inattention and hyperactivity symptom dimensions. Our study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between different types of MW and affective well-being, across different symptom dimensions of ADHD. Methods: We used ecological momentary assessment to capture participants’ momentary attention state (on-task, intentional MW, or unintentional MW) and affective valence, six times daily for 7 days. Using linear mixed-effects modelling to account for inter-individual variance, we tested whether inattention and hyperactivity symptom dim…"

However, research has yet to examine the IPV experiences of both dyad members where one or both partners has ADHD, and how those experiences differ from couples including partners without ADHD. Methods: 41 “ADHD couples” ( m age = 22.7 years), where one ( n = 33) or both ( n = 8) dyad members had ADHD, and 28 “Non-ADHD couples” ( m age = 23.4 years), where both dyad members did not have ADHD, participated. Both partners reported on the frequency they perpetrated and were victims of psychological and physical IPV. Results: Both partners in ADHD couples reported perpetrating more psychological and physical IPV than dyad members in Non-ADHD couples. Partners in ADHD couples also reported being victims of IPV more than partners in Non-ADHD couples. Conclusions: The risk of IPV perpetration in young adult couples with ADHD appears to be a two-way street. Research is needed to examine possible explanations for this pattern of reciprocal IPV, including mutual ADHD symptoms and related behavior (e.g., alcohol intox…"

Methods A total of 77 infant siblings at 3 years of age with a family history of autism only, autism and co-occurring ADHD, or no family history of these conditions (FH-TL) were assessed on behavioural lab-tasks (EF and deferred gratification), parent-rated adaptive behaviour using Vineland, and clinician ratings using ADOS-2 (autistic symptoms) and ADHD DSM-5 symptom rating scale (ADHD RS). Results Group comparisons showed that FH-autism and FH-autism + ADHD groups received lower scores on common EF, but not on deferred gratification in comparison to the FH-TL group. Lower levels of deferred gratification related to autistic symptoms, while lower level on EF was specific to ADHD sy…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Autistic adults often face co-occurring depressive symptoms. While previous studies have focused primarily on depression in children with autism, this study aims to investigate the factors associated with depressive syptoms in autistic adults. By examining a broader range of variables including sociodemographic factors and autistic traits like sensory sensitivity and restricted and repetitive behaviors, we seek to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the elevated levels of depression within this population. Methods This quantitative study utilized a cross-sectional design. Two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. The first analysis included all participants (N=438), focusing on demographic factors such as age, gender, income, in the first model and autistic traits such as repetitive behaviors, and depressive symptoms in the second model. The second analysis included a reduced sample (N=305) that additionally incorporated sensory sensitivity data. Results Older age, lower income, and a greater number of co-occurring psychosocial problems were significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms.

An online survey and focus groups were used to capture community perspectives of members of the Australian autistic and autism communities. A total of 871 individuals participated across the research activities, including autistic individuals ( n = 253), parents of autistic individuals ( n = 344), practitioners ( n = 325) and members of organisations with an interest in the assessment and/or diagnosis of autism ( n = 115). Three overarching themes, encompassing 15 codes, representing the principles that should underpin practice across the assessment and diagnostic process were developed (a) placing the person at the centre of the process; (b) understanding and valuing the whole person and (c) improving quality and access. Assessment and diagnosis for autism should go beyond diagnostic decision-making to include understanding of individual needs and identifying support pathways.

However, there is a lack of research into how autistic service users find their admissions to mental health wards. Ten United Kingdom-based autistic adults took part in semi-structured interviews to explore their experiences of being a mental health inpatient. These results were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) and four themes were developed: ‘I’m not mental health, I’m not autism, I’m just me’, ‘All the noise. All the people. All the unpredictability’, ‘You work out how to survive’, and ‘It’s the usual set up, all the decisions had been made’. Results highlighted a negative overall appraisal of inpatient admissions, with specific difficulties in a lack of nuanced autism understanding, sensory environments, unpredictability and a felt sense of powerlessness. Findings indicate further autism training is required for staff working on inpatient wards, as well as changes to sensory environments that could benefit neurodivergent populations. These changes should detail how to put in place reasonable adjustments throughout a person…",

Method: A quantitative secondary data analysis was performed on 200 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who participated in randomized control trials in either the Netherlands or Norway. Results: Overall, CBT significantly reduced ADHD symptoms from pretest to posttest on parent measures; however, treatment response varied based on gender, internalizing symptoms, and treatment formats. Girls with elevated depression showed significantly smaller reductions in ADHD symptoms compared to boys with similar depressive profiles ( p = .02), even after controlling for baseline ADHD severity. Effect size analyses revealed that girls benefited from both CBT delivery formats, but symptom improvement was nearly twice as large in individual CBT ( d = 0.90, large effect) compared to group CBT ( d = 0.49, moderate effect). Conclusion: These findings suggest that depression may impact treatment response among girls, and that individual CBT may offer enhanced benefits for adolescent girls with ADHD."

Specifically, autistic individuals may show differences in the consistency of emotional experiences, the ability to distinguish between emotions, and/or their semantic understanding of emotions. In this study, we empirically tested this claim by (1) investigating whether autistic and non‐autistic adults differed in the consistency and/or differentiation of their emotional experiences, and their understanding and differentiation of emotion concepts after controlling for alexithymia, and (2) assessing the contribution of these emotional abilities to emotion recognition. To this end, a total of 58 autistic and 59 non‐autistic individuals, matched on age, sex, and non‐verbal reasoning ability, completed a series of validated questionnaires and computer‐based emotion tasks. We found no group differences in emotional consistency, emotion differentiation, and understanding or differentiation of emotion concepts after controlling for alexithymia.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite widespread use of caregiver‐child interactions (CCX) to evaluate outcomes in autism interventions, little research has examined the dependability of this measure. This study applied generalizability theory to determine optimal conditions for dependable assessment of child communication and caregiver implementation of communication intervention strategies. Twenty caregiver‐child dyads participated in structured interactions across six daily activities on two occasions. Young autistic child communication was measured via tele‐health using the Individual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDI) and caregiver implementation using the Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Intervention Fidelity (NDBI‐Fi) scale. Both measures demonstrated strong generalizability when multiple observations were conducted, but significantly lower dependability with single observations. For child communication, three to five activities across two occasions provided optimal dependability ( Φ = 0.69–0.82). For caregiver implementation, either four activities on one occasion ( Φ = 0.80) or two activities across two occasions ( Φ = 0.81) yielded dependable estimates. The greatest sources of erro…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Parenting a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often entails ongoing emotional challenges that can contribute to parental burnout. This study aimed to investigate the mediating and moderating roles of emotional reactivity in the relationship between psychological flexibility and parental burnout among parents of children diagnosed with ASD. Methods A total of 230 parents (74.8% female; M age = 40.14, SD = 8.27) participated in the study. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling from special educational centers. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS to test indirect and conditional effects of emotional reactivity. Results Emotional reactivity partially mediated the association between psychological inflexibility and parental burnout. Higher psychological inflexibility was linked to greater emotional reactivity, which in turn predicted higher parental burnout. Moreover, emotional reactivity significantly moderated this relationship (ΔR² = 0.009, p = .025), indicating that the association between psychological inflexibility and parental burnout was stronger among parents with higher emotional…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Early identification of children at risk for Intellectual Disability (ID) is complex, as formal diagnoses are often deferred until school age. However, early signs may emerge during the preschool years. This study aims to examine longitudinal changes in cognitive, adaptive and emotional-behavioral functioning from preschool to school age, to identify early markers predictive of later ID. Methods Eighty-eight children were assessed at two time points: preschool age (T0) and school age (T1). At T0, children were categorized into three diagnostic groups: Global Developmental Delay (GDD), Mixed Specific Developmental Disorder (MSDD), and Language Disorder (LD). At T1, the same children were re-evaluated and classified into: Intellectual Disability (ID), Language Disorder (LD), and Other Diagnoses (OD). Assessments included clinical observations, cognitive evaluations, and parent-reported questionnaires and interviews. Analyses were performed separately at T0, T1, and longitudinally. Results At T0, all groups showed impaired adaptive functioning but differed in cognitive abilities, with the GDD group displaying more pronounced delays. At T1, only the ID group maintained…"

      "abstract": "Background: Media is central in shaping social evaluations of different human groups. Despite prevailing media portrayals harboring detrimental stereotypes of autism, autistic people actively use media as an accessible space for connection, advocacy, and community. Autistic people tend to resonate more with autistic peers, whereas non-autistic people form less favorable impressions of autistic people. No study has directly examined autistic and non-autistic people’s social evaluations of media content produced by autistic people or about autistic lived experiences. Here, we examined neurotype-dependent social evaluation using a novel, ecologically valid task. Methods: We compiled autistic-content and non-autistic-content videos from publicly available interviews, vlogs, reality TV, and documentaries. An advisory board of five autistic members vetted the clips. We presented these videos to 73 autistic and 223 non-autistic adults recruited from Prolific. Participants rated and interpreted the videos on three dimensions of social evaluation: connectedness (relatedness, identification), content clarity (understanding of the video), and valanced judgments (enjoyment, discomfort, friendl…",

Barriers to seeking and receiving adequate mental health care, such as minority stress, adverse life events, discrimination, and stigmatization can result in increased reliance on general and psychiatric emergency departments (ED/PsyED) during mental health crises. There is however limited research detailing PsyED use in autistic adults. Methods: This large-scale retrospective chart review analyzed PsyED visits by autistic adults (aged 16 to 63) in an urban psychiatric hospital in Canada from 2018 to 2020. Data were collected from 345 autistic patients who had 1027 PsyED visits during this 3-year period. Demographic information, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diagnoses, and reasons for PsyED visits were characterized. Predictors of reasons for visiting PsyED were examined using mixed-effects logistic regressions. Differences between single-time and recurrent visitors were explored.

We investigated whether 8 weeks of multinutrient supplementation, in a randomized controlled trial of 83 children with ADHD, would alter immune factors compared to placebo. Methods: Multiplex technology was used to measure 25 immune factors in blood samples collected at baseline and week 8. Immune factors were compared between multinutrient and placebo groups using the Mann-Whitney test. Linear mixed effects models evaluated immune factor change over time. To understand the functional relevance of the immune factors affected by multinutrient supplementation, pathway analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 Bioinformatics Resources. Results: Interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 levels differed following multinutrient supplementation versus placebo ( p = .005 and .03, respectively). IL-5 decreased by 1.3% in the multinutrient group (95% CI [−8.6%, 6.7%]) and increased by 17.5% in the placebo group (95% CI [6.9%, 29.2%]). IL-13 de…"

However, a significant percentage of young children are receiving medication treatment for ADHD rather than behavioral treatment. There is limited research capturing parent experiences of barriers to implementing behavioral health services for young children with ADHD diagnoses. This paper seeks to fill this gap by exploring these perceived barriers among parents of children diagnosed with ADHD. Method: Parents of children with ADHD diagnoses ( N = 29) were invited to participate in four focus groups to discuss their experiences with accessing treatment for their child. Focus group participants were recruited from one Southeast city through an ADHD parental support group and nationally from parents attending a conference on ADHD. Results: Three themes emerged as perceived barriers that impact ADHD treatment. Parents reported barriers that can be conceptualized as (1) misconceptions and stigma; (2) availability of financial and time-related resources; and (3) tre…"

We investigated systemic inequities in CBT access for adults with ADHD versus psychiatric diagnoses with similar prevalence. Method: We accessed and extracted publicly available listings from the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT) provider directory ( N = 12,898) in April 2025. Results: Only 26.4% of PSYPACT providers explicitly offer any services for adult ADHD. They were nearly three times more likely to treat adult depression (69.2%) and anxiety (74.0%). CBT for adult ADHD was offered by just 21.3% of providers. Conclusion: U.S. psychologists are chief CBT providers for adult mental disorders; however, they systemically underserve adults with ADHD. Contributors to this inequity must be identified to advance adult ADHD care, as untreated ADHD is a costly public health burden."

While studies from high-income countries show that tailored early intervention can be effective in learning new skills, there remains a lack of evidence-based approaches specifically designed for the realities of LMICs. Methods The study included 50 preschoolers, 25 of whom (mean age = 52.4 months) participated in an individualized developmental and behavioral program combined with parent education in addition to preschool attendance over a six-month period. The remaining 25 children (mean age = 50.5 months) attended only preschool. The intervention averaged 2.9 h per week (range: 2.1–4 h) and targeted age-appropriate developmental goals. Additionally, parents received an average of 0.6 h per week (range: 0.2–0.7 h) of education to support the generalization of skills to daily life.

The research aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel AR-based application functioning as a virtual job coach, providing real-time, context-specific guidance on completing complex job tasks. Employing a single subject multiple probe across participants design, data were collected from four young adults with IDD. The results showed significant improvements in job task performance; participants’ accuracy rose from an average of 12% during the baseline phase to 94% with the AR intervention. All participants reached mastery criteria, defined as completing at least 90% of steps correctly and independently across four sessions. The study highlights the potential of AR to improve training efficiency, reduce the demand for in-person job coaching, and broaden employment opportunities for individuals with IDD."

The objective is to explore the association between parental feelings of shame, perceived inferiority, and the overall functioning of families raising children with ASD. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 517 families across Greece. Parents completed validated questionnaires, including the External Shame Scale and subscales measuring family functioning (e.g., communication, problem-solving, personal goals). Statistical analyses included Pearson/Spearman correlations, as well as multivariate linear regressions, to identify predictive relationships. Results The findings revealed a significant negative association between maternal external shame and key aspects of family functioning, including problem solving, communication, and personal goals. Higher levels of external shame were linked to more dysfunctional family patterns, underscoring the emotional and relational burden experienced by mothers of children with ASD.

Recognizing subtle changes in intonation, pitch and prosody provides rich social information and cues for responding in everyday interactions — cues that may be missed by individuals with differences in sensory processing and social development, such as those with autism. Although atypical auditory processing in autism is well-established in the literature, the contribution of these sensory differences to emotional prosody recognition requires further investigation. This study examined whether the associations of auditory abilities and social cognition with emotional prosody recognition differ between autistic and non-autistic children. Methods Twenty-eight autistic children and twenty-eight non-autistic children completed tasks assessing rapid auditory processing (RAP), pitch discrimination, social cognition (SC), and emotional prosody recognition (EPR) of spoken words and sentences. Results Autistic children demonstrated better RAP but lower SC performances compared to non-autistic children.

This study examined the parenting attitudes and participation levels of fathers of children aged 3–6 with developmental disabilities in Türkiye. Method The sample consisted of 134 fathers who voluntarily participated. Data were collected using a demographic form, the Parental Attitude Scale (PAS), and the Father Involvement Scale (FIS) and analyzed with SPSS. Results and Conclusions Parenting attitudes did not significantly vary by the child’s gender, diagnosis, preschool attendance, or number of children. Non-working fathers showed more authoritarian attitudes than working fathers. Fathers of daughters scored higher on interest and closeness, while fathers in single-child families scored higher on caregiving and participation. A moderate positive relationship was observed between democratic parenting attitudes and FIS subdimensions. Authoritarian and permissive attitudes showed weaker positive relationships with specific FIS subdimensions, including caregiving and participation."

Ensuring the process is informed by autistic voices, is strengths-based, and addresses outcomes identified as priorities for autistic youth can pose additional challenges. This paper provides a description of the activities undertaken to combine two EBPs for use in inclusive high school settings, the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI), and Peer Supports. Points where the autistic voice was embedded in the process are highlighted, along with initial feedback from high school teachers and students. Challenges to the EBP adaptation and combination process, as well as barriers to implementation and next steps, are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated whether parental emotion-regulation difficulties are prospectively associated with increased emotion-regulation challenges in autistic children and adolescents and explored the underlying mechanisms and behavioral implications of these potential intergenerational associations. Over three time points (T1, T2, T3) spanning 2 years, 363 parents of autistic children and adolescents from Hong Kong provided questionnaire data. Path analyses revealed that parental emotion-regulation difficulties at T1 were associated with greater negative emotional expressiveness at T2, which in turn was linked to increased emotion-regulation difficulties and more internalizing and externalizing problems in autistic children and adolescents at T3. Importantly, these findings indicate that when parents have difficulty regulating their emotions and express negativity, their autistic children and adolescents are more likely to face emotion-regulation challenges and exhibit behavior problems. This underscores the need to support parents in regulating their emotions and optimizing their emotional expressiveness. Clinicians and policymakers should help parents strengthen their emotion re…",

      "abstract": "Bodily autonomy is essential to Autistic well-being. Interoception supports bodily autonomy through guiding behavior in support of homeostasis. Promoting adaptive interoceptive skills is therefore crucial to improving Autistic well-being. To date, research on interoception in Autistic people has been poorly informed by the experiences and goals of Autistic people, has had a narrow focus on comparison with non-autistic norms in search of deficits, and has had limited impact on Autistic quality of life. In this perspective piece, a team of Autistic and non-autistic researchers review findings to date and make recommendations for future research directions. We argue that participatory research is needed to comprehensively map the varied interoceptive landscape of Autistic people, ensure that new interoceptive measures are autism-relevant, and guide interventions designed to improve the interoceptive and broader well-being of Autistic people. We believe that if interoception research is conducted in partnership with the autism community, the understanding of interoceptive processing and the full range of interpretive differences that result will be impactful and informative.",

Design/methodology/approach This reflective essay draws on practice insights and field experiences of families navigating autism care. This study interprets how unpaid caregiving becomes central to sustaining children’s progress when formal services are unavailable or inaccessible. Findings Caregivers sustain essential continuity of care but at significant personal cost. Mothers frequently reduce or leave employment, leading to financial strain, emotional burnout and social isolation. These burdens remain largely invisible to practitioners and policymakers, yet they directly affect the sustainability of inclusive systems. Practical implications For practitioners and policymakers, inclusive practice requires acknowledging caregiver labour, providing structured training and emotional support and defining limits to what unpaid caregiving can sustai…"

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT At least one third of autistic people have limited or no speech. Most nonspeaking autistic people are never provided alternatives that would enable the full range of expression that speech allows, significantly limiting their access to educational, social, and employment opportunities. In this commentary, we argue that assisted methods to teach nonspeaking autistic people to type—long dismissed because the assistant could influence the text they produce during training—warrant fresh study. Although these teaching methods developed in practice rather than research, the practice (including the range of support the assistant provides in the motor, sensory, and attentional domains) is aligned with contemporary research about nonspeaking autistic people's strengths and challenges. We suggest that past research showing that influence can occur during training has been over‐interpreted to mean that influence always occurs and that nonspeaking autistic people instructed using assisted methods never learn to type independently. In fact, other research shows that influence does not always occur, and there are independent typers who attribute their skill to the range of assistance th…",

We recruited participants through a gatekeeper, professional networks, and social media. We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: Participants included seven family members and one friend in the first group and five clinicians in the second.

It has long been proposed that more hours per week in ABA produce better outcomes. ABA practice guidelines typically recommend 30–40 h per week for young autistic children.

Thus, the dosage question remains open, leaving parents and providers unsure of the ideal dosage of ABA for an autistic child to make meaningful progress. Real world data (RWD) can fill the gap between community treatment and controlled research often conducted by universities. Methods In this study, we examined the RWD data from 725 autistic children receiving ABA as part of community-based care. Using longitudinal multilevel modeling, we examined the relationship between average hours of ABA per month and change on proximal and distal measures: adaptive behavior, goal attainment, and dangerous behavior. Results Dosage was a significant predictor of goal attainment, indicating that clients who spent more time in treatment met more goals. Conversely, the relationship…",

Although it overlaps with ADHD in some features, emerging evidence suggests a unique behavioral and cognitive profile. However, research examining social functioning and emotion recognition in children with pure CDS remains limited. Methods: This study compared social competence and facial emotion recognition abilities among children aged 8 to 12 years across three groups: those with elevated CDS symptoms (n = 43), those with ADHD (n = 40), and healthy controls (n = 43). Social functioning and peer relationships were evaluated using parent- and child-report social skills scales and peer interaction questionnaires. Emotion recognition was measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Results: Children with CDS showed significantly lower social skills and RMET scores than both ADHD and control groups (p &lt; .001). Teachers reported fewer school friendships for the CDS group compared to ADHD and controls (p &lt; .001), and CDS children also reported fewer out-of-school friendships than peers in the other groups (p = .035).

We studied the effect of the type of inclusion (regular classroom vs. special education classroom) in a sample of 356 children with ASD over a three‐years period. Results first showed that, when comparing both groups at baseline, children in special education classes were older, had a higher level of challenging behaviors and came from lower socioeconomic status families. Once matched through propensity score, children in special classrooms had significantly lower communication and daily living skills than children in ordinary classrooms after 3 years, whereas there was no significant difference in socialization skills and in IQ. Overall, placement in a regular education classroom was positive for most children, however there is a high inter‐individual variability and it is very unlikely that inclusive settings are by default superior for all children with special needs.

However, the treatment intensity and effectiveness have been debated. We conducted a meta‐analysis and examined individual participant data to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical significance of the outcomes on adaptive behavior, intellectual functioning, and autism severity. We included studies of children with ASD aged 2–6 years who received EIBI for at least 12 months. The final literature search was conducted on September 26, 2024. The GRADE tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Across the 17 identified studies, we obtained participant data from 15 studies: 341 children received EIBI and 280 were in comparison‐groups. All studies had a serious risk of bias due to the lack of random assignment. Our meta‐analysis yielded effect sizes of 0.66 for improvement in adaptive behavior, 0.87 for improvement in intellectual functioning and 1.36 for reductions in ASD severity.

Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualization of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. In addition, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, the CATI was originally developed as an alternative to traditional measures, including subscales that capture traits particularly relevant to autistic women. Building on this, we collaborated in an earlier work with members of the autism community to revise the CATI (CATI-R), ensuring more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts across all genders. In the present study, we translated this revised measure into German and validated it in a large sample of female, male, and non-binary participants.

This study aimed to examine the indirect associations between parental stress and child irritability through two sequential parenting mechanisms: experiential avoidance and negative parent–child relationship, within a sample of school-aged children with ADHD (ages 6–12). Using a two-wave longitudinal serial path analysis based on parent-reported data collected at two time points 1-month apart (Time 1 and Time 2), the study investigated whether early parental stress predicted subsequent child irritability via its influence on experiential avoidance and the quality of the parent–child relationship. Findings supported the hypothesized model. More precisely, higher parental stress was associated with greater experiential avoidance, which in turn predicted more negative parent–child relationship, ultimately resulting in elevated child irritability. Longitudinal serial mediation effects confirmed that all Time 1 variables significantly predicted corresponding Time 2 outcomes across the proposed sequential pathway.

Participants were 193 children without disabilities, ages 3 to 6 years, in 16 inclusive preschool/kindergarten classrooms. Teachers and educational aides each nominated socially interested students and rated all students’ social interests toward the included classmate. Results indicated that socially interested children were younger, more often boys, had a more advanced social profile (less aggression, more shyness, and more prosocial behaviors), and showed better performance on theory of mind tasks than their peers who were not socially interested in the autistic classmates. Identifying peers without disabilities who show social interest toward the included children can optimize the involvement of peers without disabilities as change agents in inclusive educational environments and promote the social inclusion of autistic students.",

Methods: A total of 43 children with ADHD and 40 healthy controls 6 to 12 years of age were included in the study. The K-SADS-PL was administered to exclude any additional psychopathologies (excluding ODD in the ADHD group). The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale was provided to the children, while parents completed the revised Conners’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-R), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and the Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Functioning (BRIEF). Additionally, teachers of the ADHD group were given the Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale. Furthermore, the WISC-4 was administered to assess the IQ profile of 35 children in the ADHD group.

Among non-autistic adults with social anxiety, distorted negative self-imagery in social situations stemming from fear of negative evaluation from observers can be corrected in cognitive therapy via video feedback. However, the role of social imagery in the maintenance of social anxiety has not been explored in autistic adults. This study examined in 62 autistic adults: (1) quality of social imagery elicited during social situations; (2) how image qualities were related to self-reported levels of social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation when accounting for co-occurring generalised anxiety. Many autistic adults reported social imagery from a field (i.e., looking through one’s own eyes) rather than observer perspective. Using response surface analysis (RSA), autistic adults wanted to escape from/avoid social imagery and found them more upsetting when social anxiety was greater than fear of negative evaluation from others.

      "abstract": "While the Bradley et al. paper brought up an interesting question regarding the relationship between autistic identity and eating disorders, there are concerns with the assumptions and design of this study. This article concludes that autistic identity has no connection to potential eating disorder symptom severity. However, the psychometric tool used, the Social Identity Scale, is missing key aspects of autistic identity found in other tools. In addition, the tool used is not validated in autistic adults. Lay Abstract A recent paper by Bradley et al. concluded that there is no relationship between autistic identity and eating disorder symptoms. However, the survey tool used to assess autistic identity of its participants did not include key components needed to arrive at this conclusion. Variations of autistic identity that would need to be considered are manifold. Some of these facets to consider in a survey assessing autistic identity would be whether or not autism is a source of pride, traits are thought to be steadfast or changeable, stigma is felt, and whether they should perform camouflaging behavior. This is important because eating disorder symptoms can be affected by thes…",

Recognizing the need to address growing mental health concerns among autistic college students, we implemented a mental health screening and monitoring protocol within a university program devoted to supporting autistic college students. This article describes the process and service-level feasibility of implementing this program over the course of one academic year at a large public university in the Northeast United States. Anxiety, depression, and suicide risk were measured at four time points. Students with elevated risk of mental health symptoms were connected to mental health supports and received suicide risk assessments. Thirty-two individuals took part in the monitoring process across the academic year. The monitoring process identified 53 instances where monitoring, checking-in, or a risk assessment was indicated. Fourteen risk assessments occurred, and 12 students received at least one mental health referral. Leveraging interdisciplinary collaborations, the mental health monitoring program was able to connect numerous autistic college students facing mental…"

Although cognitive-behavioural therapy in group settings has been adapted for autistic populations, there is a paucity of research exploring how autistic individuals experience CBT interventions. This qualitative study investigated autistic adults’ experiences of a modified cognitive-behavioural therapy group programme for social anxiety. Twenty-seven autistic participants were recruited through clinical services and community outreach. Following the intervention, participants completed semi-structured individual interviews about their experience of the programme. Participants reported both therapeutic benefits and challenges following their participation. Themes included reflections on group dynamics, mental health impacts, social functioning and daily life applications of strategies. Peer connection emerged as a core facilitator of engagement, while structured strategies were credited with bolstering social confidence and self-awareness.

Acoustic cues, such as vocal characteristics and spatial location, help differentiate between speakers. However, autistic individuals may process these cues differently, making it more challenging for them to perceive speech in such conditions. This study investigated how autistic individuals use acoustic cues to follow a target speaker and whether background music increases processing demands. Thirty-six autistic and 36 non-autistic participants, recruited in the United Kingdom, identified information from a target speaker while ignoring a competing speaker and background music. The competing speaker’s gender and location either matched or differed from the target. The autistic group exhibited lower mean accuracy across cue conditions, indicating general challenges in recognising speech in noise. Trial-level analyses revealed that while both groups showed accuracy improvements over time without acoustic cues, the autistic group demonstrated smaller gains, suggesting greater difficulty in tracking the target speaker without distinct acoustic features.

This qualitative study represents the first exploration of how families of autistic adults in mainland China understand, support and engage with the concept of independence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 parents of autistic adults, including individuals both with and without intellectual disabilities. Through reflexive thematic analysis, four interrelated themes were identified: (1) Doing Independence Versus Being Independent; (2) From Aspirations to Reconceptualisations; (3) Invisible Needs and Misrecognised Competence; and (4) Independence as a Relational Process. These findings challenge reductive definitions of independence as mere task completion or detachment from familial support.

The proposed methodology involves collecting a data set with attributes such as verbal ability, social interaction, sensory sensitivity, and attention span for students with autism spectrum disorder. These features are preprocessed and used to train a TabNet model to categorize the autism level. The system recommends a personalized education plan through a web application, based on prediction. This study uniquely integrates autism spectrum disorder-level prediction with education planning, achieving an accuracy of 99.37% and precision of 98.91% using the Autism Spectrum Classification for Education Planning data set.

      "abstract": "There is an increasing need to measure caregiver implementation of strategies from Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBIs) as a possible key mediator of outcomes in a child. The NDBI Fidelity (NDBI-Fi) rating scheme is a macro-code to estimate the implementation of core strategies. Yet, there is a need to understand the dependability of this measure to ensure intervention study findings are generalizable to everyday interactions and comparable across studies. We addressed this by evaluating the dependability or consistency of NDBI-Fi scores for 20 caregivers, averaged across observations of two occasions of two routines that were each scored by two raters. Our findings indicated that a single score (i.e. from a single occasion, single routine, and single rater) from the measure has low dependability ( g = 0.43). When scores were averaged across two observations each of two routines scored by two raters (i.e. eight scores total), the score was more dependable ( g = 0.77). The majority (81.6%) of absolute error variance was attributable to occasions of observation and its interaction with other facets (routine or rater). Therefore, we recommend the NDBI-Fi be appl…"

Method: We conducted a systematic review with narrative synthesis, considering studies on older adults with ADHD and research on cognitive domains involved in adults 50 years old and older with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, in three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase). Ten studies (3 longitudinal and 7 cross-sectional) with clearly separated cognitive data for older adults with ADHD were included in this review. Results: Results showed an overall worse performance in attention and episodic memory for older adults with ADHD compared to their younger counterparts and older healthy controls.

This study examined the extent to which the cognitive impairments could be consequences of elevated levels of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Method: Secondary analysis was conducted on data from four groups selected from the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory, a neurodivergent cohort of children aged 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 9 years : children with ADHD only ( n = 70), learning difficulties only ( n = 406), ADHD with learning difficulties ( n = 128), and a comparison group ( n = 166). Covariance analyses examined whether any differences in basic cognitive skills and higher executive functions between the neurodivergent and comparison groups could result from variations in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Results: Irrespective of ADHD status, children with learning difficulties had low scores in short-term memory, working memory, sustained attention, processing speed, set sequencing, and set shifting.

The ‘Thinking Flexibly’ intervention has been co-designed with autistic youth based on previous work, including cognitive remediation therapy. Twenty autistic adolescents were recruited from clinical services and offered the eight-session intervention. Acceptability was assessed through participant drop-out and session completion. Participants (and their parents) also completed questionnaire measures of cognitive inflexibility, anxiety, depression and functional outcomes before and after the intervention.

      "abstract": "Purpose Despite increasing autism prevalence, delays in diagnostic assessments persist, likely impeding access to effective early interventions. In 2022, Ireland’s Health Service Executive piloted new, three-tiered Autism Assessment and Pathways Protocol in the Republic of Ireland. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was completed by six parents of autistic children assessed through the novel, Tier 1 Assessment Pathway Protocol, and 25 parents of autistic children assessed through the standard Assessment of Need Pathway participated in this study. All respondents provided quantitative and qualitative data on their experience of the diagnostic assessment pathway, including satisfaction, self-reported stress and perceived child stress. Parental satisfaction and stress were compared between pathways. Findings Some 65% of parents were satisfied with the diagnostic process overall. The process was stressful for both parents and children. There were no significant differences in parents’ satisfaction, stress levels or participant characteristics between the diagnostic assessment pathways. Time to assessment displayed negative correlations with parents’ satisfaction with the over…",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Parent–child biobehavioral synchrony, or the concordance of behavior and physiological indicators between individuals, is theorized to support children's social development; however, this relationship has yet to be investigated in autistic children. This study examined whether moment‐to‐moment physiological synchrony—indexed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)—and its interface with global levels of behavioral synchrony was associated with the pragmatic language skills and friendship quality of school‐aged autistic children in 40 mother–child dyads. Mother–child dyads participated in a collaborative task, from which RSA synchrony and behavioral synchrony were assessed. Mothers and their autistic children demonstrated negative RSA synchrony, such that when one partner displayed an increase in RSA, the other partner showed a decrease in RSA. The extent of behavioral synchrony between mothers and their children did not moderate the strength of concordance between mother and child RSA. Negative RSA synchrony was associated with better pragmatic language skills in autistic children from mother–child dyads who displayed high levels of behavioral synchrony. These findings high…",

We developed a novel instrument to capture social touch experiences of autistic adults, along with both social and individual factors that influence them. Using a body-painting task and questionnaires, we demonstrated that the perception of touch interactions varies based on social contexts and neurotypes. Autistic adults, on average, prefer touch less, but the type of relationship influences the perceived comfort and meaningfulness of touch similarly in both groups. Regarding the appropriateness, erogeneity, and pleasantness of social touch, the autistic group showed different touch perceptions in professional and friendly scenarios compared to the non-autistic group, whereas touch in intimate scenarios was perceived similarly. Sensory responsivity, touch predictability, social confidence, and touch-related anxiety affect social touch to a greater extent than the non-autistic group. Despite these marked differences in perception, the autistic adults, on average, engage in social touch as frequently as non-autistic adults, and their satisfaction with touch is compa…",

Tabletop role play games (TTRPG) groups have shown potential as a neurodiversity-affirming way to enhance the social connectedness of autistic adolescents and young adults. TTRPGs involve interactive collaborative storytelling through player constructed characters, often with involvement of a Game Master, and include games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Our study aimed to explore the experiences of autistic adolescents and young adults participating in socially led TTRPG groups. Method: We employed a qualitative phenomenological design. Thirteen participants (10 males, 1 female, 2 non-binary/diverse gender) with ages ranging between 14 and 29 years from Australia took part in semi-structured interviews, which we analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: We identified four key themes.

My main aim is to suggest a new interdisciplinary approach to autistic communication that aims to accommodate our different communication styles rather than modify our communication to fit non-autistic communication norms. I call this new interdisciplinary approach ‘autistic linguistic justice’, and introduce five concepts to help initiate research and advocacy on this topic. The concepts I introduce are: the sociolinguistics of securitization, language revitalization, linguistic human rights, language policy and planning, and language ethics. Each concept is briefly introduced, and examples are given of how they can be applied to accommodating autistic communication. In the conclusion, I provide recommendations for how families, practitioners (such as teachers and doctors), autism researchers, and autistic people can use these concepts to help build autistic linguistic justice together. Given that many of the concepts I draw on have been developed by other minoritized communities, I emphasize the need for building respec…",

One-hundred thirty-eight non-autistic community members completed an online survey; mixed-effects and stepwise regression analyses assessed relationships between contact with Autistar and stigma. Focus group interviews with 11 participants drawn from this full survey sample who had extensive contact with Autistar were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Quantitative analyses indicated that greater contact breadth with Autistar was linked to lower stigma. In particular, participation in exhibitions and introduction by acquaintances predicted lower stigma. Qualitative analysis revealed that sustained and informed contact, which allowed participants to notice similarities between themselves and autistic employees and the strengths of these employees, helped them view autistic people as part of their ingroup. This study linked contact theory and ingroup bias theory to explain how high-quality contact may be associated with perceiving autistic people as part of one’s ingroup.…",

We aimed to use adaptive behavior and cognitive scores abstracted from health and educational records to describe trends over time in the population prevalence of autism by adaptive level and co‐occurrence of intellectual disability (ID). Using data from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, years 2000 to 2016, we estimated the prevalence of autism per 1000 8‐year‐old children by four levels of adaptive challenges (moderate to profound, mild, borderline, or none) and by co‐occurrence of ID. The prevalence of autism with mild, borderline, or no significant adaptive challenges increased between 2000 and 2016, from 5.1 per 1000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6–5.5) to 17.6 (95% CI: 17.1–18.1) while the prevalence of autism with moderate to profound challenges decreased slightly, from 1.5 (95% CI: 1.2–1.7) to 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1–1.4). The preval…"

      "abstract": "Autism interventions are predominantly developed in high-income countries, limiting access for families in low- and middle-income countries due to systemic, cultural, and logistical barriers. The Caregiver Skills Training program aims to address this disparity by equipping caregivers with practical skills. This scoping review examines the cultural adaptations, facilitators, and barriers to the implementation of Caregiver Skills Training, focusing on its accessibility, feasibility, and acceptability. A comprehensive search of ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified eligible studies that reported cultural or linguistic adaptations of Caregiver Skills Training. Forward searches and manual reference checks supplemented the review. Data were extracted using the Cultural Adaptation Checklist framework and analyzed for patterns in adaptation, training, barriers, and facilitators. Seventeen studies across Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America highlighted diverse adaptations in language, content, and delivery methods. Facilitators included community partnerships and task-shifting with non-specialists, while barriers involved logistical challenges, stigma, and resource constr…"

Post-trauma appraisals are fundamental in cognitive models of post-traumatic stress disorder, but have not been explored in autistic people. We aimed to explore whether we could replicate effects of heightened trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity in autistic adults, and examine how post-traumatic appraisals affect the association between autism and post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity. Two hundred forty-two autistic ( n = 148) and non-autistic adults ( n = 94) completed a survey measuring trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity and post-trauma appraisals. Exposure to types of traumatic events did not differ significantly between the groups, but the autistic group endorsed more events that ‘happened to me’ directly. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptom severity and endorsement of negative post-traumatic appraisals were significantly higher in the autistic group, specifically alienation, shame and fear appraisals. These appraisals mediated the association between a…",

An important aspect of the experience of females with ADHD is the impact of the menstrual cycle and ovarian hormones on both the symptoms of ADHD and effects of stimulant medications on treating these symptoms. Method: In the present pilot study, female participants being treated with amphetamine salts for ADHD ( n = 30) were recruited to complete 35 daily online surveys to track ADHD symptoms, mood, and medication use through the menstrual cycle. Results: Results indicated that the degree of ADHD symptoms was significantly associated with menstrual cycle phase with ADHD symptoms being most severe in the menstruation phase and comparatively milder ADHD symptoms in the mid-follicular phase. This difference was positively correlated with subjective changes in negative mood. Conclusion: These results indicate that ADHD symptoms vary across the menstrual cycle among females being treated with amphetamine salts for their ADHD, a finding that could inform clinical and prescribing practices for physicians caring for females with ADHD."

We conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial to understand whether oral CBD oil containing terpenes can improve outcomes in autistic children. Twenty‐nine children (18 male), aged 5 to 12 years ( M = 9.62 years, SD = 2.05), diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, completed the study. Participants received weight‐based dosing of CBD oil (10 mg/kg/day) or matched placebo oil over two 12‐week intervention periods (crossover), separated by an 8‐week washout period. Outcome measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale‐2 (SRS‐2; primary outcome), PROMIS Social Relating, Anxiety, and Sleep, Developmental Behavior Checklist‐2 (DBC‐2), Vineland‐3, and Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI; secondary outcomes). There was no significant effect observed for the primary outcome measure (SRS‐2) for CBD oil relative to placebo oil after 12 weeks ( β = −11.15, SE = 7.19, p = 0.125).

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous studies concluded that theory of mind (ToM) development is deviant in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Typically developing children's ability to understand that one may hide their emotion would be acquired before false belief understanding in children with ASD (e.g., Peterson and Wellman 2019), but with contradictory results (e.g., Zhang et al. 2016). In the current work, we aim to determine whether the order of acquisition of ToM‐related concepts in ASD differs, using methodological improvements compared to previous studies. Our results support the conclusion of a non‐deviant developmental trajectory for ToM in individuals with ASD, with a general ability to understand hidden emotions that is not mastered before false belief attribution.",

Caregivers of 45 young autistic children (70.7 ± 23.3 months) and those of 36 neurotypical peers (59.2 ± 11.8 months) carried a mobile device for 7 days to repeatedly record their child's social interactions and in‐the‐moment anxiety. They also completed the Social Responsiveness Scale‐2 and the Theory of Mind Inventory‐2 to evaluate their child's severity of autistic symptoms and ToM abilities. Multilevel analyses found that young autistic children with higher ToM abilities were more likely than those with lower abilities to interact with peers (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01–1.23) but also experienced more anxiety during interactions with both peers and adults (OR = 1.36, 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12–1.67, 1.01–1.63). In contrast, no significant associations between ToM and social interactions or anxiety were found in the neurotypical group. This study highlights the critical role of ToM abilities in the real‐life social engagement of autistic children and emphasizes the importance of understanding real‐time subjective social experiences.",

The economic impact of autism is significant. One intervention found to be efficacious is social skills training (SST); however, there are few economic studies of SSTs. This study addresses the dearth of cost analyses of SSTs in the literature. An ingredients method was used, with cost data collected through informant interviews, program budgets, and the E$timator Tool Kit . Results revealed the SST implementation cost was lower than other autism-focused Early Intensive Behavioral Interventions; families bear the largest proportion of costs; and optimizing personnel-heavy interventions like SST may be possible through high-quality, intensive training of lower wage personnel by experienced trainers who also provide ongoing support and supervision."

From an autistic perspective we explore neurotypical heterosexual neuromixed love stories and autistic counter love stories focusing on how neurotypical and autistic characters are represented. Our main findings are two dichotomies and two happy endings. In neurotypical heterosexual neuromixed love stories, the dichotomy of a female autistic grotesque and the male neurotypical savior is central where the happy ending is curing or masking autism, upholding both heteronormativity and neuronormativity. In autistic counter love stories, the happy ending is rather framed as unmasking and founding a way of life outside of neuro- and heteronormativity for both parties.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Given the rising prevalence of autism among racial minority children in the United States, but persistent service use disparities, this study examines potential bias in specific items from the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS), a highly regarded autism evaluation. We leveraged unidimensional item response theory graded response models and a sample of 735 children to analyze the differential item functioning (DIF) of items within ADOS Module 3. Three items showed significant signs of racial bias: A1 (overall language level), A5 (offers information), and D5 (compulsions and rituals). On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and the impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0–48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. This analysis suggests a small but d…"

Data are collected from multiple sources, involving 189 ASD children and their teachers across 22 regular primary schools in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. Following behavioral experiments, questionnaire assessments, and data analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM), this study reveals three key findings: (1) both peer relationships and teacher–student relationships negatively affect aggressive behaviors in children with ASD; (2) perceived discrimination positively influences such aggressive behaviors; and (3) both peer and teacher–student relationships indirectly influence aggressive behaviors through the mediation of perceived discrimination. These findings emphasize the need of enhancing on‐campus social connections to reduce perceived discrimination among ASD children, thereby mitigating aggressive behaviors, and highlight the necessity of fostering a…",

This study explored sustainability of daily routines and patterns of accommodations in families of autistic preschool-aged children with or without intellectual disability from culturally, ethnically, and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Eleven parents participated in semi-structured, ecocultural family interviews (EFI). Researchers used the EFI codebook to rate the intensity of family accommodation activities and sustainability of their daily routines, and then conducted a thematic analysis of the results. Findings show that families’ accommodation activities varied in intensity in multiple ecocultural domains – from low levels to high – depending on available resources and children’s needs. For the majority of families, irrespective of their cultural background, three overarching themes of family accommodations were identified: (1) mother involvement and commitment; (2) being socially isolated; and (3) importance of public…",

Yet, to date, most research exploring the effects of the virtual-representational-abstract (VRA) instructional sequence has been conducted in researcher-implemented settings. However, to ensure researchers are able to provide accurate practice recommendations, more research is needed to explore the teacher implementation of this intervention. The purpose of this concurrent multiple probe across participants single-case design study was to examine the effects of a teacher-implemented VRA instructional sequence taught via explicit instruction on the accuracy with which three elementary students with ASD solve addition with regrouping problems. The VRA instructional sequence involved the use of virtual base ten blocks, drawings, and abstract numerical strategies to solve addition with regrouping problems. Researchers found a functional relation between the VRA instructional sequence and student accuracy. All three students were also able to maintain their accuracy after intervention ended. The teacher was able to implement the VRA instructional sequence after only two…",

Research shows police behave inequitably during interactions with marginalized communities and may behave even more inequitably toward individuals with multiple minoritized identities. Many autistic people also identify as gender diverse. However, it is largely unknown if or how autistic adults’ perceptions of police differ by gender identity. We examined autistic adults’ perceptions of policing, autism, and gender using an online questionnaire. Results revealed significant differences across gender groups (cis women, cis men, gender diverse) in perceptions of justice, comfort in disclosing diagnosis, helpfulness of diagnostic disclosure, influence of gender, and concern that one’s autistic traits would be misperceived as dangerous. These findings align with widespread calls for police reform and suggest current policing practices likely do not meet the needs of all autistic individuals, particularly autistic cis women and gender diverse individuals, who are more likely to report their gender has influenced police interactions and more concerned that their autistic…",

We interviewed 22 autistic young people (aged 9–22 years, M Age = 14.5) after they engaged in a social interaction with a stranger in immersive virtual reality. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we found that participants generally found virtual reality interactions tolerable, engaging and helpful as a low-pressure first step towards more challenging social situations. Virtual reality was valued for reducing sensory overload, increasing confidence and offering novel social opportunities. However, participants did not view virtual reality as a replacement for in-person interaction, which they saw as essential for building meaningful relationships.

Method: Two experiments employed a gaze cue–target paradigm using inhibition of return (IOR) as an indicator of exogenous attentional orienting. Experiment 1 used normal upright gaze faces as cues. Experiment 2 used inverted gaze faces as cues. Results: When normal gaze faces were used as the gaze cue, no IOR effect was observed in children with ADHD (Experiment 1); whereas when inverted gaze faces were used as the gaze cue, the IOR effect was produced in children with ADHD (Experiment 2). Conclusion: These results indicated that the ability to produce exogenous attentional orienting to the gaze cue is impaired in children with ADHD and that this impairment resulted from their reduced ability to exogenously orient to the intact face. These findings provide new evidence of social cognitive deficits and attentional orienting deficits in children with ADHD, and help provide support for children in educational settings."

Method: A systematic search identified relevant studies, and methodological quality was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), with data analysis conducted using Stata software. Results: A total of 36 studies (38 comparisons) were included, comprising 10 acute and 26 chronic exercise interventions. Exercise yielded a small-to-moderate improvement in inhibitory control but showed no significant effects on hyperactivity/impulsivity or inhibition-related N2 and P3 components. Subgroup analyses of inhibitory control revealed significant moderating effects of age (children/adolescents), intervention type (chronic interventions), frequency (three sessions per week), control condition (sedentary or no-intervention groups), and study quality (studies with moderate or high risk of bias). Conclusion: Exercise enhances inhibitory control in individuals with ADHD, with the effe…"

However, the specific co-occurrence patterns of ADHD symptoms and different functions of aggression remain unclear, as does their relationship with parenting practices. This study used a person-centered approach to examine the co-occurrence patterns of ADHD symptoms, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression and their associations with parenting practices. Method: A total of 1,152 mother-adolescent dyads participated in this study (adolescents: M age = 14.29; 48.0% girls). Latent profile analysis was conducted to identify adolescent profiles of ADHD, reactive, and proactive aggression, followed by multinomial logistic regression to examine relationships between these profiles and auxiliary variables. Results: Latent profile analysis identified three patterns of adolescent- and mother-reported ADHD symptoms, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression: low symptom (84.4%), reactive co-occurrence (10.0%), and complete co-occurrence (5.6%).

This study examined the incidence, sociodemographic risk factors and co-occurrence conditions of ASD, including categorization by ID, using national registers. Methods This study included singletons born in Finland between 1998 and 2015 who had been diagnosed with ASD by 2018, with cases categorized into ASD with ID and ASD without ID. We divided the study sample into four birth cohorts (1998–2002, 2003–2007, 2008–2011 and 2012–2015) to analyze changes in incidence over time. Cases ( n = 10,171) were matched with controls ( n = 49,391) by age, gender, and birthplace. Associations between sociodemographic risk factors and ASD were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Co-occurrence with other psychiatric disorders was examined only in the oldest cohort (1992–2002). Results The cumulative incidence of ASD without ID increased from 0.52 to 0.89% by age 10, while ASD with ID remained stable at 0.17%.

However, reasons for elevated rates of anxiety in autism remain poorly understood and there is a high unmet need for novel and adapted therapies for anxiety that are accessible to autistic people. This study aimed to establish the feasibility of a novel app‐based anxiety management tool (“Molehill Mountain”) that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people. A single‐centre, single‐arm feasibility study design was employed, whereby autistic people (≥ 16 years) with mild‐to‐severe symptoms of anxiety were recruited to a 13‐week intervention period (King's College London, UK; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT05302167). Of 123 prospective participants screened, 100 (81%) participants aged 16–74 years ( n = 69 female) were enrolled within approximately 15 months. n = 76 (76%) completed an anxiety measure at ~15 weeks (Generalized Anxiety Disorder—7 Item Scale; GAD‐7). Most adhered to the full intervention duration: 65% ( n = 47), with most using the app weekly (1–6 days per week; 58%). 73% of participants agreed that they found the app easy to use overall and that an app is a good for…",

However, very little research has explicitly evaluated intervention approaches that may lead to increased parent self-efficacy for parents of young children with autism. The current study is a mixed-methods evaluation of parent self-reported self-efficacy and perceptions following an NDBI that included strength-based video feedback coaching. We explored (a) parent perceptions of the intervention using a social validity questionnaire and (b) parent self-efficacy using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All parents rated the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention favorably with strong probability of the parents continuing the intervention in the home. While pre-post results were approaching significance, no statistically significant differences on parent self-efficacy ratings were present ( z = -1.841; p = .066). Parent responses to open-ended questions revealed that video feedback allowed parents to observe the successes of their child in ways that were not po…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Motor impairments are pervasive in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with atypical gait patterns often observed but understudied in early development. The aim of this pilot study was to analyze spatiotemporal gait parameters and variability in toddlers with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) peers. Methods The study included 12 ASD and 9 TD male toddlers, aged 18–30 months, walking independently. We extracted spatiotemporal gait parameters from laboratory recordings of walking. Gait variability was assessed via coefficients of variation for each parameter. Group differences were tested and exploratory correlations between gait parameters and motor skills were assessed. Results Results indicated increased gait variability in the ASD group across parameters, suggesting less consistent motor control. Significant differences in variability were observed in stride length, step length, stance time, and stride time. Conclusion This pilot study confirms that an objective assessment of gait is feasible in toddlers with ASD. Future research is needed to replicate the results in a larger sample, to explore underlying neurological mechanisms, as well as the impact of atyp…",

With respect to high secure psychiatric care (HSPC), a 2017 survey examining the experiences of autistic patients found most reported both positive and negative aspects associated with their care, and variable quality of life (QoL) ratings. Since this, several significant changes have occurred including moving to a new hospital site, the introduction of the mandatory Oliver McGowan autism awareness training and the national strategy for autistic children, young people and adults outlining the need to improve autistic individuals’ experience of the criminal justice system. This paper describes a repeat survey of patient experiences to see whether they may have changed or improved in light of these changes. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative data about the experiences of autistic individuals detained in a UK HSPC hospital was gathered using semi-structured interviews and the forensic QoL questionnaire.

      "abstract": "Abstract Caregiving for children with Down syndrome (DS) is a long-term responsibility that often results in significant stress and anxiety for family caregivers. It is essential to comprehensively understand caregivers’ stressors and coping strategies to develop effective stress reduction interventions and policies. Despite existing research, there is a lack of comprehensive qualitative studies that collectively explore these aspects. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-synthesis of 58 qualitative and mixed-methods journal articles, focusing on the persistent stressors faced by caregivers and the coping mechanisms they use to mitigate stress. In addition to stress and coping, this synthesis captures the emotional experiences associated with the caregiving journey. This synthesis provides valuable insights for developing targeted stress-reduction interventions and caregiver support programs. Implications for practice, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed."

Design/methodology/approach In total, 200 parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 40 in each country) completed a series of scales about their parenting stress and coping styles. Findings The results suggested more similarities than differences. Parenting stress was high in all countries, and the highest was in the UK. Pessimism was also high in low-to-medium-income countries, and lower in Greece and the UK. Passive appraisal was used most often as a coping style, with mobilising the family being used more than social support. Cross-country, the only difference was that the UK parents used seeking spiritual support less than parents from other countries.

To better understand how chaos may affect adaptive functioning, this study aims to establish whether parental worry mediated the link between chaos in the home and the adaptive functioning (communication, daily living skills, socialization) of children with ASD compared to those without ASD. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 202 parents, 99 with a child with ASD and 103 without ASD. Parents responded to the Confusion, Hubbub and Order Scale, asking about the chaos level in their home.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether the peripheral levels of these molecules differ in children and adolescents with ADHD. Method: A total of 90 patients with ADHD aged between 8 and 18 years and 60 healthy controls were included in this study. The severity of ADHD symptoms was determined with the Atilla Turgay Scale. Child Anxiety-Depression Scale-Revised was completed to evaluate additional psychiatric problems of the patients. Serum levels of biochemical parameters were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.

Typically, people receive information about the surrounding environment through their senses collectively. However, sensory processing problems may occur when sensory signals do not integrate to provide appropriate responses. As a result, the environment may cause a person to feel confused or irritated.

Over 600 subjects participated including education specialists (n = 546), adults with developmental disabilities (n = 58), and administrators and staff (n = 30). The target population was individuals who experienced difficulties with sensory processing, integration and modulation, caregivers, educators, and administrators who worked with the target population. Results The findings show that individuals with sensory processing disorder view their environment differently than the general population. The data gathered was analyzed and coded to reflect six sensory categ…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Routine developmental screening is essential for early identification of autism. Reliable autism screening is even more valuable for individuals from minoritized groups who are often under-detected and receive later diagnoses. Despite this importance, disparities in access to screening and accurate identification persist. Given these disparities, we were interested in examining group differences in autism screening rates at 18 and 24 months of age among children referred to Georgia’s Part C Babies Can’t Wait (BCW) program between 2018 and 2022. Method Among a sample of 52,282 infants and toddlers enrolled in BCW, as hypothesized males and children with private insurance had higher screening likelihoods compared to females and children with public insurance. Results Unexpectedly, Black and Hispanic children were more likely to be screened than their counterparts. To examine this further, an examination of screening timing revealed that White and male children were more likely to be screened before their referral to BCW compared to peers. Conclusion This reveals continued inequities in screening timing but suggests that BCW providers serve an important role in identi…"

The TAP-P is a play-based instrument with varied administration and scoring procedures based on a child’s language level. This study compared tele-assessment using the TAP-P to in-person autism assessment. Methods Participants were 116 children (aged 36–71 months) referred for autism evaluation. Participants first completed in-home tele-assessment (administration of the TAP-P, clinical interview, and Developmental Profile 4). All participants then completed in-person assessment with a different psychological provider, including cognitive or developmental assessment, adaptive behavior assessment, and autism-focused assessment (ADOS-2). Caregivers completed questionnaires after each appointment assessing their perceptions. Results When asked to make a binary decision about presence or absence of autism, tele-assessment and in-person clinicians agreed for 82% of participants (n = 95). In most instances of diagnostic disagreement (n = 17), tele-assessment clinicians indicated the absence of autism and in-person clinicians indicated th…",

Methods: This retrospective cohort study used routinely collected health data. We identified a cohort of adults with diagnosed autism who accessed mental health services and linked these with records of admissions to English general hospitals. We measured whether clinicians recorded autism in each admission. We calculated the proportion of admissions in which clinicians recorded autism for each year between 2007 and 2023. We used regression models to identify factors associated with the likelihood that clinicians documented autism during the admission. Results: In total, 4182 autistic adults together had 20,184 admissions. Admission level sensitivity of autism recording was 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI:] 37.1%−38.5%).

Design/methodology/approach A systematic search and reflexive thematic analysis details the intentions of 43 autistic bloggers as described within blogs themselves. Findings Blogging created meaningful routes to belonging, feeling “connected but safe”. Blogs provided well-being resources for use personally (for reflection, self-acceptance and emotional expression) and to support peers. Bloggers also said they wrote to re-narrate how autism is understood by their readers, to speak with honesty without secret-keeping and to challenge stigma. Personal accounts chronicled and explained past pains caused by navigating what it means to be autistic. Blogs contained non-stigmatised and personally meaningful descriptions of autistic experiences, which the authors said were not available in other published sources.

Participants also completed measures of autism-related knowledge and explicit attitudes towards autism, and an implicit bias task. Data were analysed using generalized additive models weighted by newspaper exposure, along with hierarchical partitioning to estimate the variance explained by reading preferences and other factors. Newspaper-related factors accounted for 4.5% of the variance in explicit attitudes and 10.7% in implicit attitudes. Crucially, selective engagement with right-leaning tabloids was associated with more negative implicit attitudes. Furthermore, selective trust in these outlets predicted relatively favourable explicit but relatively negative implicit attitudes. Overall trust in newspapers was also linked to less accurate autism…",

We also discuss strategies that can be used to work toward this goal. We detail the recruitment and retention of 94 Spanish–English bilingual Latinx (primarily Mexican and Central American) families from low-income households across a large urban city and its surrounding communities in the United States for an assessment validation study. We use the method of this study as an example of how to engage and include underrepresented populations in autism research, describing the efforts that were implemented to engage families and community-based organizations serving this population.

Methods: In this study, we drew from a nationally representative sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of ~1,400 middle to older adults ( M age = 66.9, SD = 8.4; 41.4% male; 60.7% White) who completed a set of cognitive measures and an ADHD symptomatology questionnaire in the 2016 Wave of the HRS. A multigroup path model was run by examining the association between self-reported ADHD symptom subscale scores for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity as well as self-reported depressive symptoms and cognitive outcomes across three groups: middle age, young-old, and middle-old. Results: Inattention symptoms were significantly associated with Serial 7s and Immediate Recall, however the constrained model was the best fitting model, suggesting no differences in the associations between self-reported inattention symptoms and cognitive outcomes by age.

      "abstract": "Adolescence marks a time of increased vulnerability to developing mental health difficulties. Recent literature has pointed towards both risk and protective factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of co-occurring mental health difficulties amongst autistic adolescents. For example, autistic individuals may mask their autistic traits to fit in with neurotypical peers, but prolonged masking may negatively influence the development of one’s autistic identity and increase vulnerability to developing mental health difficulties. In this commentary, we focus our efforts on highlighting how 1) autistic identity and 2) masking behaviours may be considered within a holistic and person-centred formulation to guide treatment for mental health difficulties in autistic adolescents. In current clinical practice, mental health practitioners may not explicitly enquire about potential construct overlap between these autism related factors and other cognitive and behavioural factors that perpetuate mental health difficulties. We propose a series of assessment questions that clinical professionals may use when developing a shared understanding with autistic adolescents of how they p…",

Non-autistic people frequently perceive autistic people more negatively than non-autistic people, although we do not fully understand the real-world consequences of this perceptual bias. This study extends previous work by investigating these perceptual biases within a real-world context: university. Method: Non-autistic university students ( n = 25) watched short, candid video clips of autistic and non-autistic people. Participants rated different aspects of the stimulus model’s academic experience, focusing on their motivation to study, academic success, grades, and happiness at university. Results: Across all measures, non-autistic participants judged the academic experience of autistic models more negatively than non-autistic models, perceiving lower academic motivation, success, grades, and happiness at university. Conclusion: These results demonstrate a consistent negative bias that autistic students may face from their peers at university. We discuss th…",

Methods: Fifteen autistic adults (five women) took part in this qualitative interview study in which we probed their understanding and experiences of uncertainty and its links to feelings of anxiety. We applied a grounded theory approach to transcripts of the interviews, broadly following Charmaz’s constructivist epistemology, to derive a theory of uncertainty as it is experienced by the autistic people we interviewed. Results: From the interviews, we derived a model of uncertainty, which identified three different levels of uncertainty, ranging from the certainty of the “known,” through to the relatively manageable uncertainty of the “known unknown,” to the anxiety-provoking “unknown unknown” or that which cannot be made known. We propose in this model that anxiety can be understood as resulting from difficulties with avoiding or controlling the latter types of uncertainty through plan…",

Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 12 autistic youth and young adults (ages 17–29 years old) about their workplace experiences and perspectives. We conducted interviews virtually and used a grounded theory approach to analyze and organize the transcribed interview data into themes. Results: Six themes of workplace supports emerged from the data.

Although there has been some research exploring basic psychometric properties (reliability, convergent validity, etc.) of the WHOQOL-BREF in autistic populations, the underlying latent structure of the measure has not been tested in autistic adults. Our goal in the current study was to compare different confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models to test which one best captured the underlying latent structure of the WHOQOL-BREF data in a sample of autistic adults. Methods: A total of 842 autistic adults between the ages of 18 and 83 years completed the WHOQOL-BREF. Based on participant responses, we compared four a priori CFA models—correlated four-factor, unidimensional, higher-order, and bifactor models—to demonstrate which model structure best captures the underlying latent structure of the measure in this population.

The use of identity-first versus person-first language and impersonal references to autism can affect how autistic people are perceived. These factors should impact the representation of autistic people in newspapers, where negative and stereotypical representations are often perpetuated. Method: We asked five autistic people to judge the sentiment toward autism and autistic people in 1000 quotes from British newspapers (2011–2020). The coders, who did not know the newspaper title and time of publication, made their judgments based on two dimensions, warmth and competence, from the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We examined the overall judgments of warmth and competence and considered variations in language context and terminology, such as the use of impersonal references to autism or identity-first and person-first language. We also examined potential differences between broadsheets and tabloids, left- and right-leaning newspapers, and changes over time.

These challenges may result from both the nature of autism and the developmental tasks associated with this unique developmental stage. Given the challenges and barriers faced by this population, understanding the relationship among factors in this transition period and developing relevant interventions are crucial. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between autism acceptance and coping strategies and understand how they impact the quality of life (QOL) of this population. Method: In total, 204 autistic youths aged 18–26 years recruited from Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk completed an online survey consisting of instruments measuring target variables. Two parallel mediation models were examined to explore the relationships between autism acceptance, coping, and QOL. Results: Both parallel mediation models showed good fit. In the first model, perceived acceptance had a significant direct effect on QOL (β = 0.512, p &lt; 0.01) and a significant indirect effect through engagement coping (β = 0.059, p &lt; 0.01).

      "abstract": "Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) affects many autistic individuals, and has been linked to suicidality in this group. It has been closely linked to difficulties with intrapersonal emotion regulation, but a role of interpersonal emotion regulation processes in NSSI has been underexplored. Empathic disequilibrium is a state of imbalance between a person’s cognitive empathy (CE) and emotional empathy (EE). We recently found that autistic people exhibit heightened EE relative to CE, consistent with their firsthand reports of hypersensitivity to the emotions of others. Because this kind of empathic imbalance is associated with hyperarousal and emotional reactivity, we hypothesized that it might increase the risk of NSSI, which often occurs as a means of trying to regulate overwhelming or distressing emotions. Methods: We measured CE, EE, emotional reactivity, and NSSI behaviors in 304 autistic and 289 nonautistic participants, and used polynomial regression with response surface analysis to examine empathic disequilibrium as a predictor of emotional reactivity and engagement in NSSI. Results: Replicating previous research, individuals with an autism diagnosis were more likely…",

Emerging but limited evidence also suggests a proportional overrepresentation of gender-diverse identities in autism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report gender diversity prevalence in autistic adults in the United States. Methods: We report the prevalence of gender diversity within two well-characterized samples of autistic adults recruited from SPARK (Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge), the largest online research database of autistic individuals to date. This study includes both an original sample (Dataset 1, n = 205) and a replication sample (Dataset 2, n = 243). In addition, we looked at the co-occurrence of anxiety and/or mood disorders with gender-diverse identities. Results: We found that 16.1% of autistic adults in Dataset 1 and 19.8% of autistic adults in Dataset 2 were gender diverse.

This study surveyed 204 undergraduate students with and without autism. Participants were asked about their perceptions regarding their everyday hindrances and compensatory strategies. Results indicated that procrastination and irregular sleep schedules are significant barriers to academic success for both groups. Autistic students also report challenges related to their diagnosis, such as sensory concerns, difficulties with changes in routine, and apprehension over working with others. Despite these differences, both groups utilize similar compensatory strategies, such as summarizing readings and maintaining routines. Findings emphasize the necessity of interventions targeting procrastination and sleep habits for all students and additional supports provided for autistic students in the areas of socialization, group work, and postsecondary classrooms.",

We conducted a multivariate random‐effects meta‐analysis with a multilevel structure on 25 studies (828 autistic participants; M age = 3–28 years) to estimate: (a) changes in eye‐tracking outcomes from pre‐ to post‐treatment ( k = 179); and (b) the correlation between baseline eye‐tracking profiles and changes in developmental outcomes following treatment ( k = 39). Our analysis revealed a moderate and significant summary effect size for changes in eye‐tracking outcomes from pre‐ to post‐treatment (Hedge's g = 0.32, p = 0.010). Additionally, a moderate but non‐significant summary effect size was revealed for the correlation between baseline eye‐tracking outcomes and changes in developmental outcomes following treatment (Fisher's z = 0.20, p = 0.115), with moderation effects observed based on developmental domain and sex.

Recommendations for reducing barriers in diagnostic processes are reviewed, including improving existing adult autism measures and developing new ones, especially self‐report/interview tools capturing what cannot be externally observed; providing more information about the process ahead of time and better post‐diagnostic support; better assessment of psychosocial and mental health histories; training to promote clinicians' understanding of adult autism; and the importance of considering culture.

This study compared the core autistic symptoms, co‐occurring psychopathologies, feeding behavior and dietary intake among 737 Chinese children with autism (mean age = 7.76 years; 642 males and 95 females) who either experienced no FGID or experienced one of the three subtypes of ROME‐IV FGID. FGIDs were present in 19.8% of participants and MANCOVA revealed distinct clinical profiles across FGID subtypes. Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) were associated with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, including restricted and repetitive behavior, anxiety, sensory hyperresponsiveness, externalizing behavior, and feeding patterns of emotional under‐eating, slowness in eating, and increased satiety response.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Autism encompasses a wide range of developmental abilities. Notably, nearly 30% of children fail to achieve phrase speech by kindergarten, even when provided with years of early interventions or participation in rigorously conducted clinical trials. Our understanding of why these challenges persist is limited by an underrepresentation of minimally verbal (MV) children in autism research. Consequently, our understanding of benefits from early intervention is limited. There is promising evidence that minimally verbal autistic children may benefit from an adaptive approach that can address their dynamic needs. Adaptive interventions give service providers the ability to adjust strategies and approaches to match the needs of an individual. A critical component of an adaptive intervention approach is the ability to assess response to the intervention in order to make a decision on the best course of action. Previous work in identifying response to intervention has identified key predictors such as IQ, age, and expressive language ability. However, it may be helpful to examine core developmental skills as important variables driving decisions in adaptive intervention approaches.…",

      "abstract": "Compared with their non-licensed peers, licensed autistic adults appear to report more positive outcomes in objective measures of quality of life, particularly participation in activities outside of the home. We examined if this is due to individual differences/factors or the ability to independently drive. We conducted a prospective follow-up survey study of 16–21 years old in the United States and compared engagement in activities outside of the home over time by licensing status. Our final sample included 111 young adults; at follow-up, 62% did not have a permit or a license, 18% had obtained a permit, and 20% were licensed. Generally, travel patterns were consistent, except for reported increases in employment. The lack of overall differences across groups over time suggests individual differences in resources, barriers/facilitators to traveling, or general characteristics may underlie objective measures of quality of life rather than the obtainment of a license. Furthermore, regardless of licensure status, most respondents were not traveling everywhere they wanted to go, and nearly 80% were interested in a transportation modality they did not currently use.

The present study investigated whether varying maintenance demands would influence inhibition performance among children with and without ADHD. Materials and Methods: The study sample comprised 80 children aged between 7 and 11 years (60 males and 20 females; M age = 9.01). For the first time in the literature, participants completed a Go/no-go Task with four levels of gradually increased working memory load. The data was analysed using mixed repeated measures ANOVA. Results and Conclusion: A significant main effect of group, load and interaction were obtained.

The dual-pathway model links specific temperamental traits to ADHD symptom domains: elevated reactive traits, surgency and negative affect, to hyperactivity/impulsivity, and a low regulatory trait, effortful control, to inattention. Method: One hundred fifty-eight adults (79 with clinical diagnoses of ADHD and 79 controls) filled in the Adult Temperament Questionnaire. Consistent with a compensatory extension of the dual-pathway model, it was hypothesized that effortful control would moderate the effects of reactive traits (surgency/negative affect) on hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and influence both ADHD symptom domains. For exploratory purposes, orienting sensitivity, an adult temperament factor related to perceptual sensitivity, was included in the analyses. Results: Binary logistic regression identified lower effortful control as the strongest predictor of an ADHD diagnosis. Negative affect had a significant but small effect, while surgency and orienting sensitivity were non-significant. Two hierarchical regressi…"

      "abstract": "Background: Autistic adults often experience high levels of stress and difficulties in coping with stressors in everyday life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) groups, adjusted for autistic adults in an outpatient context. Methods: We conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled effectiveness trial during the years 2018–2020. Autistic adults ( N = 77) were recruited from outpatient services and randomized to either MBSR ( n = 39) or treatment as usual, TAU (i.e., continued regular services, n = 38). We used linear mixed models with random intercept to analyze the effects of intervention on self-rated perceived stress (primary outcome), as well as mental health, mindfulness skills, quality of life, and autism acceptance (secondary outcomes). In addition, we collected qualitative data at exit discussions in the MBSR groups and examined the transcription using thematic content analysis. Results: Participants (52% female) had a mean age of 40 years, with a majority being unemployed at the time of inclusion (64.9%) and having at least one co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis (87%).

Study 1 is a randomised controlled trial evaluating the ADHD Sleeping Sound © intervention to compare outcomes between in-person and telehealth modalities. Study 2 examined whether baseline sleep problems and treatment response were predicted by baseline symptom presentation, attachment security, and family functioning. Method: Children aged 5 to 12 years (65.4% male) with ADHD received either in-person ( n = 40) or telehealth ( n = 38) treatment. Subjective (Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire) and objective (actigraphy) sleep variables were assessed at baseline, post-intervention (1 week), and follow-up (3 months). Results: As expected, subjectively measured sleep disturbance significantly improved post-treatment, with no significant difference in rate of change between in-person and telehealth modalities. For Study 2, baseline measures comprised the Conners CBRS, Attachment Insecurity Screening Inventory, Security Scale, and Family Assessment Device.…"

We administered an anonymized, self‐report survey to 424 autistic and 345 non‐autistic adults through a convenience sampling framework. Binomial logistic regression models identified whether trauma and autism diagnosis were related to (i) self‐harm, (ii) suicide attempts, (iii) suicide plans, (iv) a mental health condition that impacts daily life, and (v) substance use to cope. Heatmaps were generated to identify traumas that frequently co‐occur with psychological distress and SRB. After accounting for trauma and demographic differences, autism remained a significant predictor of all outcomes, except whether individuals used substances to cope (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.54–1.12, p = 0.18). Autistic people were more likely to report self‐harm (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.85–4.00, p &lt; 0.01), suicide attempts (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.65–3.68, p &lt; 0.01), suicide plans (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.41–2.83, p &lt; 0.01), and experiencing a mental health condition that impacts daily life (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 2.42–5.33, p &lt; 0.01) than non‐au…",

Additionally, risk of suicidality is often found to increase with age in the general population. Despite this, suicidality has seldom been explored in autistic populations in midlife and old age. This study investigates the self-reported prevalence of self-harm and suicidality in autistic people in midlife and old age compared to an age- and gender-ratio comparable non-autistic group. Methods In total, 388 participants (autistic n = 222, 44% men) aged 40–93 years (mean = 60.9 years) from the AgeWellAutism study completed questionnaires related to experiences of suicidal ideation, self-harming thoughts, deliberate self-harm, and suicidal self-harm. Group, gender and age differences were examined in chi-square and linear regression analyses. Results The autistic group reported significantly higher rates of suicidal ideation, self-harming thoughts, deliberate self-harm, and suicidal self-harm than the non-autistic comparison group.

We used multilevel modeling to analyze Medicaid billing claims for 1,028 autistic youth under the age of 21 years to examine the extent to which there were disparities in hours of ABA services for Medicaid-enrolled youth based on race/ethnicity and rurality. Although younger children received more hours of ABA, F (1, 964.63) = 118.28, p &lt; .001, there were no statistically significant differences in hours of ABA based on minoritized race/ethnicity status or sex. On average, youth served in rural areas received significantly less hours of ABA per month than those in non-rural areas, F (1, 122.13) = 7.89, p = .006; youth in rural areas received 10.86 less hours per month than those in non-rural areas. Results suggest that publicly funded service systems like Medicaid may reduce ABA service disparities by race/ethnicity. Policymakers should focus on improving service provision for youth in rural areas.

Previous work shows that, for autistic people, alexithymia, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and anxiety mediate the relationship between SP differences and RRB. However, these studies use anxiety measures developed for the general population, and more recent evidence suggests that autistic people may have a different anxiety experience. This study aims to extend previous findings by unpacking the anxiety experience for autistic adults in the relationship between SP differences and RRB, using an autism‐specific anxiety measure. Data were available from 426 autistic adults. Serial mediation models tested the relationship between SP differences and RRB, with alexithymia, IU, anxious arousal, and social anxiety as mediators. We identified significant direct effects from SP differences to both repetitive motor behaviors (RMB) and insistence on sameness behaviors (ISB). For RMB, we found indirect effects through anxious arousal, alexithymia‐anxious arousal, IU‐anxious arousal, and a…",

Methods In the first phase, parents and teachers of 3,727 children (aged 4 and 11 years) completed screening questionnaires (CAST and EDUTEA, respectively). In the second phase, 623 children were individually assessed, and diagnoses were based on DSM-5 criteria (58 children with autism and 51 with subthreshold autistic traits).

Instead of simply listing barriers, we set out to identify true, evidence-based strategies that could help patients and clinicians maximize long-term dedication to care. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed 52 peer-reviewed articles between 2014 and 2024. The primary sources used were five electronic databases (Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, and Taylor &amp; Francis). The studies included heterogeneous age groups—children, adolescents, and adults—and had diverse methodologies ranging from randomized controlled trials to qualitative interviews. Results: Adherence to treatment for ADHD remains a problem, especially among teenagers. We organized the influencing factors into five main areas: sociodemographic, psychological/clinical features, medication-related issues, beliefs and attitudes, and broader systemic or environmental challenges. Conversely, interventions like pharmacological strategies, digital interventions and mobile-based reminders, psychoeducational and behavioral approac…"

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Autism and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are each associated with increased psychiatric emergency department (PsyED) use, yet the service impact of coexisting autism–BPD remains unclear. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 1027 PsyED visits by 345 autistic adults (2018–2020) at an urban Canadian psychiatric hospital to compare service patterns between those with and without a BPD diagnosis. Sociodemographics, presenting reasons, restraint use, and disposition were analyzed using mixed‐effects logistic regression. BPD was documented in 33.5% of visits and in 11.0% of unique autistic individuals, more often in birth‐assigned females. Among all autistic individuals' PsyED visits, an autism diagnosis was documented in 60.2% of their text‐based charts. Furthermore, autism was documented less frequently when BPD was recorded, suggesting possible diagnostic overshadowing. Suicidality as the primary reason for visit was associated with documented BPD (OR 4.366, 95% CI 2.659–7.169; p &lt; 0.001).

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Since COVID-19, tele-based methods of autism assessment have been relied upon to a previously unparalleled degree; however, the need for such advancements is not new. Observation-based measures are a crucial component of face-to-face autism diagnostic evaluations, but few validated observation tools exist for remotely assessing autism across childhood, offering minimal guidance for older children and adolescents. Sanchez and Constantino previously validated a brief, face-to-face, clinician-facilitated observation coded according to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2). During the pandemic, this measure was adapted as a remote observation, but has yet to be validated in this format. Methods The current study validated this remote observation against the in-person Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), in a sample of 30 children ages 1-16 years ( M = 7.25, SD = 4.05). Results The remote observation was highly correlated with the ADOS-2 ( r = .75, p &lt; .001) and Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition ( r = .74, p &lt; .001), and demonstrated acceptable sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (80%) in predicting resear…"

Group comparisons for depot-specific adiposity and metabolic markers were performed using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI z -score. Results: The ADHD + Obesity group exhibited significantly greater visceral adiposity than the Obesity-only group, as reflected by a 16.84 cm 2 larger visceral fat area (VFA) and a 1.03 kg/m 2 higher fat mass index (FMI). The ADHD + Obesity group also showed a more adverse metabolic profile, including elevated liver enzymes and fasting glucose.

We used a FER task that varied in task type - matching (comparing whether two facial expressions convey the same or different emotions) vs. labeling (identifying the specific emotion depicted by a facial expression), emotions’ intensity (high vs. low), and type of emotion (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise).

      "abstract": "Objective: Discourse-level language abilities are critical for successful participation in social, academic, and vocational pursuits. These abilities encompass both narrative and non-narrative genres, each serving distinct communicative functions. Narrative discourse involves spoken accounts of events or experiences, typically with a setting, characters, and a sequence of actions. Non-narrative discourse includes genres like explanations, arguments, and descriptions that convey information or ideas without a temporal structure. The aim of this review was to synthesise extant literature on discourse abilities of children and adults with ADHD across these genres. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted via CINAHL, PsycINFO, Medline, and ProQuest. The review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO [CRD 42022377007]. Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in our review. Most studies investigated the narrative abilities of children with ADHD. ADHD was associated with atypical verbal output, characterised by atypical brevity and verbosity, dysfluency, reduced syntactic complexity, and grammatical errors. Individuals with ADHD produced fewer pronouns and conj…"

This study aims to describe dietary issues, including nutritional problems and overexposures to food additives in autistic children, and their associations with clinical symptoms. Methods This case-control study involved 836 children (469 with autism and 367 without autism; mean age = 8.3 years) profiled on autistic symptoms, eating behaviors, and dietary patterns with parent-reported questionnaires. Nutritional insufficiencies, dietary quality and food additives exposures were compared using regression models adjusted for age and sex. Multivariate logistics or linear regression models were used to identify clinical symptoms that predict dietary issues, with mediation analyses examining eating behaviors’ roles. Results Autistic children had lower protein intake, more vitamin and mineral insufficiencies, higher exposure to food additives, and poorer diet quality. They consumed fewer fruits/vegetables and more animal-based fats, with 38.2% exceeding 125% of the Estimated Energy Requirement (vs. 22.9% controls), suggesting energy-dense, ul…",

      "abstract": "Abstract The current review synthesises research exploring the views from autistic students about their experiences in mainstream education. Autistic students experience significantly higher rates of mental health difficulties compared with their neurotypical peers and are vastly overrepresented in permanent exclusions. Research has identified low sense of belonging as a common experience among excluded students; however, there remains a relative paucity of research exploring autistic students’ perspectives on their educational experiences. It is therefore important to undertake a review of research exploring autistic students’ views on the challenges of mainstream secondary school in order to identify the potential barriers to their sense of belonging and psychological wellbeing. Fourteen studies were critically appraised in relation to the review question, and an adapted version of thematic synthesis was utilised to synthesise the findings. Twelve descriptive themes emerged from the data, which were conceptualised into four analytical themes: ‘feeling unsupported and misunderstood by peers’, ‘experiencing sensory overload in the school environment’, ‘feeling inappropriately suppo…",

Mobile health apps are promising tools for delivering scalable CBT. The current study reports findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a CBT-informed health app for adults with ADHD. Methods: A sample of assessed adults with ADHD ( N = 154; ages 18–55 years) were recruited to participate and randomized to either 8 weeks of use of the CBT-informed app or a waitlist control condition. Participants in both groups completed measures of ADHD symptoms and functioning at baseline, at 4 weeks, and at 8 weeks. Results: Linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements revealed significant group x time interactions for inattentive symptoms (η 2 = .15), hyperactive-impulsive symptoms (η 2 = .05), and ADHD associated quality of life (η 2 = .04) in favor of the CBT-informed app relative to participants who knew they were not receiving help; however, these results did not extend to a measure of functional impairment.

      "abstract": "Background: Research has consistently demonstrated a negative correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and the prevalence of ADHD, with SES exerting a significant influence on brain development. ADHD, closely intertwined with neurological development, often manifests as impairments within brain regions associated with memory, executive function, and emotion regulation. Nevertheless, the specific brain structural mediators linking SES to ADHD remain unclear. Method: We explored whether the brain surface area (SA) and thickness (TH) mediated the relationship between SES indicators (Townsend deprivation index at recruitment, average total household income before tax, and job involves heavy manual or physical work) and ADHD utilizing two-step Mendelian Randomization (MR) and multivariate MR method. Results: The MR analysis indicated that higher SES corresponds to a lower prevalence of ADHD. Genetically predicted household income was positively correlated with the SA of insula (β = .31, p = 1.02 × 10 −4 ), and physical work was positively correlated with the TH of entorhinal cortex (β = .74, p = 3.73 × 10 −5 ). Mediation analysis showed that the SA of insula was identified as a pa…"

      "abstract": "Many music therapy practices with autistic people have focused on intervention with autistic children. There are a growing number of studies reporting that many autistic adults experience loneliness and negative mental health outcomes. In Indonesia, support for autistic adults is complicated by the various understandings influenced by traditional and spiritual beliefs and limited acceptance of autism in the general public. Therefore, there is a need for psychosocial support for this age group in a format and style that suits their preferences and needs. This article describes the emerging practice of an online music group with six autistic young women aged 20–24 in Indonesia. This group met weekly for 12 weeks and was facilitated by a qualified music therapist. We identified four themes using reflexive thematic analysis, including “eagerness to connect,” “sharing music and life stories,” “being with people who accept and affirm autistic people,” and “entering a supportive autistic community.” Learnings from this emerging practice suggest that an online music group could support identity formation and solidarity by offering these autistic young women the opportunity to see themselve…",

Across Strange Situation studies, secure classifications ranged 31.5%–59.0%, with disorganization frequently elevated relative to typical comparison groups. Caregiver sensitivity and insightfulness were associated with greater security; limited longitudinal evidence linked early security with later social inclusion and empathic concern. Overall, children with ASD form organized attachments, yet validity concerns around modified laboratory protocols and the promise of home-based assessments justify dual-method, longitudinal designs and rigorously evaluated sensitivity-focused interventions.",

      "abstract": "Research on ageing in autism has sharply increased following a number of influential publications that highlighted the lack of knowledge in this area. However, much of the research on autism ageing has inadvertently treated all people aged over 50 as a homogeneous ‘older adult’ group, overlooking important distinctions between midlife (40–64 years) and old age (65+ years). Midlife is marked by complex role management, career pressures, health changes and identity development, while old age often involves retirement, shifts in priorities, physical and cognitive changes, and planning for less independent living. Recognising midlife and old age as distinct life phases is essential to accurately characterise the lived experiences and needs of autistic adults across the latter part of the lifespan. This letter makes conceptual and methodological suggestions that autism researchers should align with established ageing frameworks by labelling samples accurately, using appropriate keywords and, where possible, stratifying analyses by age subgroup. Doing so will enhance research accuracy, improve indexing and increase clinical relevance. This shift is vital for advancing autism ageing resea…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Social media has increasingly become a platform where individuals share and seek information about autism. However, recent research indicates that autism-related content on TikTok often contains misleading or inaccurate information. Additionally, the number of adults seeking first-time autism diagnoses has increased over the past several years, potentially due to increased public awareness and exposure to content on social media. In order to understand how autistic adults are engaging with TikTok, there is a need to examine content focused specifically on autism in adulthood. This study aimed to address this gap by analyzing TikTok content associated with the hashtags #actuallyautistic, #latediagnosedautistic, and #autism. Methods A content analysis of 150 videos examined themes, attitudes, clinical accuracy, and user engagement metrics. Additional analyses were run to examine common traits that users reported in relation to autism. Results A significant portion of videos were either personal in nature or misleading. Content analysis showed that many topics centered around identity related to autism diagnosis, and many associated themes were negative. There were si…",

Despite growing interest in early identification, opportunities to collect and integrate diverse presymptomatic data remain limited. This study aimed to inform the design of an at-home assessment kit for collecting genetic and environmental data related to later autism diagnosis by interviewing interestholders about the acceptability and feasibility of such a kit. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 mothers or future mothers of children from groups associated with varying genetic and environmental factors related to later autism diagnosis. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis, including second cycle and axial coding. Results Seven primary themes emerged from the analysis: (a) willingness; (b) concerns; (c) supports; (d) research participation; (e) goals of research; and (f) impediments to research engagement.

While there is significant evidence that audiovisual (AV) integration is altered in the temporal domain in autism—and that these differences are associated with presentation of SCI and RRBIs—very little is known about how autistic individuals integrate AV information in the domain of space. Methods We conducted a free-response AV spatial localization task in autistic and non-autistic children aged 7–17 years to understand better AV localization abilities, as well as how these abilities relate to SCI, RRBIs, and other clinical features of autism. Results While we found no group differences in AV spatial performance, an exploratory analysis revealed three clusters of autism features that were significantly predictive of performance across groups: a motor/somatosensory cluster, a sensory responsivity cluster, and a social communication cluster.

By addressing the researcher’s relationship to power, both as a potential target and as a bearer of privilege, this tool resists the colonial impulse to claim objectivity, instead embracing shared authority and relational accountability. Each question serves as a provocation, prompting continuous reflection on the ethical complexities of knowledge creation while resisting appropriation and extractivist tendencies. More than a methodological intervention, this framework embodies a living praxis—one that demands researchers to embrace discomfort and center those whose narratives have long been silenced in their research endeavors.

This study aims to address this problem. Methods We recorded eye movements from 34 children with ASD (6–16 y) and 40 age-matched typically developing (TD) peers while they viewed six picture sets that independently manipulated hue, luminance and saturation. Nine eye-movement metrics were extracted per task and analysed with mixed-effects ANOVAs; false-discovery-rate control (q = .05) and Holm–Bonferroni corrections were applied across 54 planned tests. Results Across all tasks, the ASD group showed a 29% reduction in total fixation time (F = 11.13, q &lt; .001; p Holm &lt; .001†), a 19% reduction in fixation count (F = 5.88, q = .027), and 42% fewer saccades (F = 16.06, q &lt; .001; p Holm &lt; .001†). Individual fixations were shorter (F = 8.40, q &lt; .001; p Holm &lt; .001†). These differences generalised across all areas of interest.

Best practice guidance suggests that generic inpatient units are poorly suited to many autistic patients. This meta-analysis synthesised the highly variable empirical literature reporting the prevalence of autistic people in such settings. Systematic searches of three databases were conducted, with eighteen studies included in the final review. The pooled estimated prevalence was 10% (95% confidence interval: 6–14%), compared to a 1% prevalence of autism in the general population. Significantly higher prevalence was estimated for children (13%) vs. adults (4%). A structured risk of bias assessment suggested that the quality of studies was highly variable. High levels of heterogeneity were explored statistically. Despite best practice guidelines stating that many autistic people would have their needs best met in specialty units, autistic people are over-represented in generic psychiatric inpatient settings.",

This mixed-methods study investigated the impact of clothing-related tactile hyper-sensitivity on autistic adults’ lives, focusing on appearance dissatisfaction, appearance awareness, self-esteem and self-expression through clothing. An online survey was completed by 86 autistic adults in the United Kingdom. Regression analysis revealed a significant predictive relationship between tactile hyper-sensitivity and appearance dissatisfaction. Moderation analysis revealed a significant negative relationship between tactile hyper-sensitivity and self-esteem, moderated by appearance dissatisfaction. Moderation of the relationship between appearance dissatisfaction and self-esteem by appearance awareness was not significant, but both appearance constructs were independent negative predictors of self-esteem. Three themes relating to the impacts of clothing-related tactile sensitivity were generated through thematic analysis of open-ended questions: ‘Negative consequences’, ‘Managing clothing-related tactile sensitivity’ and ‘T…",

This qualitative study explored lived experiences of heightened rejection sensitivity in this population. Purposive sampling through social media was used to recruit 19 autistic adults aged 21–71 (11 women, 8 men) who self-reported heightened rejection sensitivity. Face-to-face or online semi-structured interviews were held. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was utilized to analyse the data, and synthesized member checking was conducted to ensure data accuracy. Participants described their rejection sensitivity as profoundly overwhelming, exhausting emotions and thoughts when anticipating or perceiving rejection and criticism. These responses could be accompanied by physical tension, pain and reliving past rejections. Its intensity varied greatly depending on contextual factors (e.g. baseline mood and topic of rejection) and was frequently invalidated. Identified predisposing factors included inherent autistic traits and lifelong rejection experiences. Many strategies were employed to alleviate these chal…",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although there are clear international standards for intervention science and reporting in healthcare, implementation and uptake have been limited within autism intervention research. To address this concern, a Special Interest Group (SIG) was convened at the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) Annual Meetings in May 2023 and May 2024. This SIG comprised members of the autistic community, senior clinical scientists, clinicians, advanced researchers, and early career researchers, who discussed and debated quality standards for autism intervention trials. This commentary summarizes relevant literature highlighted by SIG panelists and recommendations generated from small breakout groups and larger group discussions with SIG attendees. We recommend that all journals publishing autism intervention findings, especially autism‐focused journals, institute mandatory reporting practices (e.g., trial registration, protocol, analysis plan) to facilitate transparency and rigorous autism intervention science, as well as related education initiatives in support of this goal. Findings from the SIG offer practical, actionable recommendations that we advocate be systematically…"

Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a widespread, low-cost alternative to traditional CBT, helping to reduce demands on therapists without sacrificing efficacy. However, the predictors of treatment outcomes in iCBT for this population remain understudied. This study used data from a randomized clinical trial evaluating parent-led, therapist-supported iCBT among 57 autistic youth with anxiety disorders to examine whether repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, pretreatment anxiety severity, parent-rated externalizing symptoms, verbal intellectual ability, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity predicted treatment outcomes. Methods Hierarchical linear modeling was used to test the impact of these predictors on changes in evaluator-rated and parent-reported anxiety severity. Results Higher baseline anxiety severity was associated with greater improvement in evaluator- and parent-rated anxiety scores across the trial, while fewer externalizing behavior problems predicted more improvement in parent-report…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Categorical induction, the ability to transfer a known category’s properties to a new category member, develops early and robustly in typically developing (TD) children but has proven challenging for autistic children and adolescents. We investigated whether autistic and TD adolescents might perform similarly on a categorical induction task when expressive language was controlled for, and whether autistic and TD children’s categorical induction abilities improved longitudinally. Methods Twenty-two TD and 20 autistic participants completed a ‘Diversity’ categorical induction task as adolescents. For the longitudinal analysis, we examined a subset (19 TD and 14 autistic participants) who had also completed an ‘Early’ categorical induction task as five-to-seven-year-olds. Results When expressive language was controlled for, groups did not statistically differ on categorical induction performance in adolescence. Expressive language also predicted performance above and beyond nonverbal IQ in both groups. In the longitudinal analysis, we observed that both groups’ categorical induction performance significantly improved over time, and the magnitude of improvement did not…",

We studied the effects of additive treatment for sleep problems on self-reported symptoms of ADHD as primary outcome, with subscales of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, objective, performance-based ADHD symptoms, sleep quality, fatigue, and depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes. Methods: Preliminary open-label randomized controlled trial of adult patients diagnosed with ADHD and a positive screening for at least one sleep disorder. Participants were recruited between March, 2020 and May, 2023, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventy patients (60% female, mean age 27.9 years [ SD = 8.2]) were randomized to a 12-week period of: (1) ADHD treatment as usual (TAU, n = 25), (2) ADHD TAU + sleep treatment ( n = 22), or (3) stand-alone sleep treatment ( n = 33). Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. A total of 20% of participants did not complete the post-treatment assessment. Primary analyses compared changes between groups 1 and 2. Exploratory within-group analyses were conducted to asse…"

Decoding involves pattern recognition and sentence parsing, while linguistic comprehension requires understanding semantic context. Each component may differentially relate to social processing, carrying implications for reading among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often exhibit atypical social processing and communication. Methods We investigated relationships between social behavior patterns and literacy subskills among children aged 6–11 with ( n = 18) and without ( n = 27) ASD. We examined associations between behavioral attunement during a cooperative task between children and their parent, children’s scores on standardized reading assessments, and children’s autism symptoms. Behavioral attunement was coded through video recordings of child-parent interactions. Results Controlling for general intelligence, behavioral attunement was positively associated with reading comprehension and negatively associated with phonemic decoding and autism symptom severity in neurotypical and autistic children.

The current study explores how autistic participants perceive the potential of XR technologies to amplify their strengths, align with their priorities, and navigate barriers, guided by research questions focused on the adoption, relevance, and empowerment of XR tools for the transition-aged autistic population. Methods This study conducted focus group sessions with 12 autistic participants within the PHoENIX XR environment, using structured activities, virtual tours, and interactive tasks to gather data. Results Data were analyzed through a three-phase qualitative coding process, revealing two primary categories: Autistic-Centered Considerations and Technology-Centered Considerations. Overarching themes and subthemes were identified that provide nuanced insights into both the needs of transition-aged autistic individuals relative to XR and the affordances and limitations of XR platforms in supporting them.

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Autism, psychosis and catatonia were once considered part of schizophrenia. While both autism and catatonia have been “detached” from schizophrenia, co-occurrence of the three conditions may be suspected in some cases, because of overlapping features, leading to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. This review provides an overview of the literature regarding the co-occurrence of autism, psychosis and catatonia. Methods A scoping review of peer-reviewed original research articles that simultaneously described all the three diagnostic constructs (autism, psychosis and catatonia) was performed. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, the review was based on MedLine, Scopus, PsycInfo and Cinahl databases. Studies included patients of all ages, races and both genders. A Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) of the contents of the articles was also performed. Results Seventeen articles ( n = 17) out of a total of 752 (after removing duplicates) met inclusion criteria, most of which (65%) were case reports/case series. Overall, majority of the studies lacked description of diagnostic procedures regarding psychosis - especially while describing co-occurrence of psychosis and catatonia…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Neuronal connectivity is refined throughout development by the proliferation and pruning of axons in cerebral white matter, and progressive axon myelination that enables rapid communication across brain regions. Differences in connectivity have been observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including changes in white matter volume and connectivity. In the prefrontal cortex, this includes imbalances between short- and long-ranging axons, consistent with a pattern of local hyperconnectivity, and long-range hypoconnectivity. Alterations in temporal lobe white matter development—critical for social behavior—may contribute to atypical neural connectivity. Methods We used electron microscopy to analyze 54 samples of temporal lobe white matter from 27 age-matched postmortem brains from males with ASD and neurotypical (NT) controls, ages 2–44 years. Defined regions of superficial (SWM) and deep (DWM) white matter were sampled from superior temporal (STG) and fusiform (FG) gyri. Axon density and myelin thickness were quantified, with axon size classified by inner diameter, to evaluate age-related differences between ASD and neurotypical brains. Results In neurotypical…",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Whilst research in multilingualism and autism is increasing, there is still a gap when it comes to understanding how multilingual autistic individuals use their multiple languages. The aim of this research was to survey these linguistic behaviours from a self-report perspective and compare them to non-autistic multilingual individuals. Methods We collected data from 364 participants of which 177 (autistic = 98; mean age = 44.5, non-autistic = 79; mean age = 42.2) were included in the final analysis. Multilingual usage and switching behaviour were measured through an online questionnaire made available on Qualtrics, developed for the purpose of this research. Results The questionnaire revealed that autistic participants rated themselves as more multilingual, based on number of languages known, and used their respective languages more than non-autistic participants, although they reported switching between their languages as more effortful than non-autistic participants. A large portion of autistic individuals also reported using a non-native language daily and a similar number of autistic and non-autistic participants reported having lived in a country where their f…",

Despite increasing numbers of women entering reproductive years with this diagnosis, there is limited research on it in the perinatal period. Objective: To critically appraise the available literature and examine the association between maternal ADHD and depression in the perinatal period. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by searching EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Google Scholar up to August 2024. The available literature was evaluated in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework, and a narrative synthesis was completed. Results: Ten studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The majority were of medium quality, with issues identified in sample size, study design and validity of the self-report scale used. Our review found a prevalence of 16.76% to 57.6% of perinatal depression in women with ADHD. An increased risk of developing p…"

Methods The DASCA is a caregiver-report instrument created using a mixed-methods approach. Qualitative components of this approach included focus groups and cognitive debriefing interviews. Quantitative components included dimensionality analysis, differential item functioning, and item response theory modeling. The item bank was iteratively refined to assess social communication skills that are typically acquired by early- to middle- childhood. Results The final DASCA item bank contains 184 items. Expressive language was a major factor in determining the appropriateness of some items for certain groups of children. Negligible differential item functioning, primarily by age, was observed for some items. Ho…"

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose An increasing number of autistic students in the United States are seeking post-secondary education. In response, some post-secondary institutions have established Autism Support Programs (ASP) to address the comprehensive needs of this population. There is little up-to-date, comprehensive information about which institutions host these programs, what types of services they offer, and what is required to access them. Methods Expanding on previous research, we introduce a new method, which utilizes established data science techniques, to identify ASPs at post-secondary institutions in the U.S. Our technique also allows us to identify the characteristics of the ASPs, including admissions requirements, cost, structure, and supports offered. Results Results highlight our method is more efficient and more robust than previous methods from the literature. For example, we identify 49 schools hosting ASPs that were not identified in past literature searches. We report on the characteristics of identified ASPs such as application process, most common supports and program cost. Conclusion The bi-directional change in the number of ASPs shows that this is an evolving field, r…",

These young people can become especially vulnerable if their sexual behaviour is inappropriate. Methods The current studies explored the effectiveness of culturally attuned Behavioural Activation to enhance safeguarding five autistic young people, while at the same time, not abrogating safe and appropriate sexual behaviour. The intervention was delivered via telehealth services. Results A significant decrease and eventually cessation of public masturbation (in four participants) and undressing others without their consent (in one participant) was observed. Conclusion Findings are discussed in terms of adaptations to the intervention to suit the Arab culture, individual family preferences, as well as implication for SHE and the use of Behavioural Activation more generally."

The prevalence of ASD has increased in the last decades, and research has widened its study to the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP). Therefore, it is important to develop effective screening tools to detect ASD and BAP in the general population. The Autism Spectrum Quotient, Children´s version (AQ-Child) is a 50-item parent-report questionnaire developed to assess autistic traits in children aged 4–11 years. The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the AQ-Child to Spanish as part of a school-based screening program in Salamanca, Castile and León, Spain. Methods The AQ-Child was translated, pilot-tested, and administered online through the Qualtrics platform of the University of Salamanca to a school population sample ( n = 602). Results A total of 45 cases scored at or above the established cut-off point of 76 points on the Spanish version of the AQ-Child (AQ-Child-SV) and 18 scored between 70 and 75 points.

We evaluated a shortened version of the 65-item Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). Methods A total of 1,462 dyads from the Simons Simplex Collection consisted of a child with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of ASD and a sibling without ASD. All siblings were free of suspected intellectual disabilities and severe learning disabilities, had neither developmental nor psychiatric disorders, and did not have an Individual Education Plan for extensive special education services. Areas under Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) curves quantified scale performance. A non-inferiority margin of − 0.005 was pre-specified. Results The AUROC for the 5-item scale (5iSRS) was 0.9943, the predictive value positive was 97.3% and predictive value negative was 96.9%. The AUROC for the 65-item SRS was 0.9926, resulting in an AUROC difference of 0.0017 (95% CI=[– 0.0003, 0.0037]) and meeting the non-inferiority criterion.

Method: The population-based cohort study utilized Danish nationwide registers to identify mothers of all childbirths between 2010 and 2018. ADHD diagnoses, defined as ICD-10 codes (F90 or F98.8) or redemption of ADHD medication prescriptions, were recorded during 1994 to 2023. Women who received an ADHD diagnosis prior to the five-year pre-birth period were excluded. We estimated calendar-year adjusted incidence of first-time maternal ADHD diagnoses using Poisson regression, and compared incidence across pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, postpartum up to 2 years, and 2 to 5 years postpartum, reporting adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs).

Results: The mean age was slightly higher in the ADHD group, but not significantly. Male predominance was observed among ADHD cases, although not statistically significant. While neonatal hospitalization rates were similar, the duration was longer in the ADHD group ( p = .009). Cesarean delivery and lower maternal education levels were significantly more common in the ADHD group ( p = .004 and p = .013, respectively). No significant difference in overall progesterone use was found between ADHD and control groups (17.5% vs. 19.1%; p = .749). Injectable progesterone was used in 5.2% of ADHD cases and 10.8% of controls ( p = .130), and the timing of use across pregnanc…"

Methods: ADHD diagnosis was identified based on ADHD management plans in school records, physician notes in billing records, and/or prescription records. Prescription records identified LAS-treated students ( n = 15,544), excluding those treated with immediate/intermediate-acting stimulants or atomoxetine. A control group without ADHD ( n = 204,681), and another with untreated ADHD ( n = 27,880) were also identified. The following outcomes were examined using multivariate regression: report card scores, standardized assessment exam performance, graduation from high school, school attendance, and transition to post-secondary education. Results: ADHD was associated with lower average report card scores and provincial assessment exam scores and increased frequency of school absence among grades K-12, and decreased likelihood of high school graduation and transition to post-secondary education. LAS treatment was associated with improved report card (score estimate −4.93 Treated, −6.19 Un…"

Before the intervention, the children’s autism severity, verbal comprehension, and Theory of Mind skills were assessed. Each child received four 30-min training sessions over 4 weeks, during which they watched four dramas performed by human or robot actors, in which one character shared an event with another character, who then displayed an empathic response. Parents completed a questionnaire before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention, and children’s cognitive empathy (CE), affective empathy (AE), and prosocial behavior (PB) were evaluated in an experimental task. Results Both RBI and HBI training promote empathy skills, specifically CE, AE, and PB, as evaluated through children’s verbal responses in story tasks. Conclusion RBI empathy training demonstrates comparable reliability and effectiveness to human teaching, suggesting that RBIs can assist human therapists in promoting empathy in children with autism.

Depression is highly heterogeneous and may present differently in populations with ADHD. This study aimed to explore different symptom presentations of depression and associated clinical correlates in a clinical ADHD sample. Method: We analysed data from the Study of ADHD Genes and Environment (SAGE). Parents completed semi-structured interviews about their child’s psychopathology at baseline ( M age = 10.9 years) and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire to capture their child’s depression symptoms approximately 5 years later ( M age = 14.6 years, N = 246). Depression symptom presentations were derived by latent profile analysis. Results: Analyses found three presentations of depression symptoms: a ‘low symptoms’ class (48.5% of the sample), a ‘high symptoms’ class (15.5%) with consistently high depression symptoms, particularly for suicidality and poor self-esteem items, and an ‘irritable/poor sleep’ class (36.1%) with high scores for irritability and poor sleep and intermediate levels of other depression symptoms.

Methods: Eight autistic adults who self-identified as currently unemployed or underemployed who were actively seeking to change their employment status participated in semi-structured interviews, analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: Four group experiential themes were identified: feeling paralyzed (the past weighs heavy; fragile self-confidence); powerlessness (lack of agency; systemic support failures); negative perceptions (feeling misunderstood; fear of judgment; pressure to meet societal expectations); and recognizing our needs (managing mental health difficulties; importance of self-understanding). Participants felt paralyzed by employment experiences, which impacted their confidence to progress with their career aspirations. Autistic people felt misunderstood, judged, and powerless within support systems, which had implications for their mental health. Participants recognized the importance of managing their mental healt…",

      "abstract": "Background: Difficulties in making and maintaining social relationships is common among autistic people. These difficulties are thought to be due to differences in autistic social interaction and social communication that have been theorized to be the result of reduced social motivation. We argue that this theory does not account for camouflaging, a combination of strategies that are employed frequently by many autistic individuals in pursuit of obtaining social relationships; however, its utility in achieving satisfactory friendship and intimate relationships for the individual is not clear. Method: This review synthesizes empirical evidence of camouflaging as a strategy for achieving friendships and/or intimate relationships among autistic adolescents and adults. A systematic search yielded 1421 records. Forty-nine full texts were screened, and eight qualitative studies were retained. Results: Results reveal that camouflaging was a main strategy in pursuit of friendship, with little evidence for intimate relationships, in this sample of autistic adolescents and adults. For most, camouflaging is exhausting, often ineffective and inefficient, and ultimately a challenge to one’s soc…",
